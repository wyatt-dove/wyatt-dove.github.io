                    Upon using a Grenade or Class Ability, or upon dealing Powered Melee damage, one stack of <b>“Empowered Abilities”</b> is granted for <b>5 seconds,</b>
                    boosting the recharge rate of the two other abilities. Empowered Abilities can stack up to <b>two times.</b><br><br>

                    Empowered Abilities grants <b>400% / 800%</b> bonus base Grenade and Melee regeneration rate and <b>25% / 50%</b> bonus base Class Ability regeneration rate at <b>1 / 2 stacks.</b><br><br>
                    While Empowered Abilities appears as only one buff on your screen, the recharge rate for your three Abilities is tracked separately. For example, if you use your Grenade ability, you will see “Empowered Abilities” on your screen, 
                    and your Melee and Class ability will gain the first tier of regeneration boost for five seconds. If you then use your Class Ability before the timer expires, your Grenade will gain the first tier of regeneration boost for the 
                    full duration, and your Melee will gain the second tier of regeneration boost for the full duration. Your Class Ability’s regeneration boost will not refresh and will expire after the initial five seconds has elapsed.<br><br>

                    While any of your abilities have the second tier of regeneration boost, the buff on your screen will show as “Empowered Abilities x2.”

                    Spirit of Verity inherits the Grenade damage bonus of Death Throes from the Exotic Warlock Helmet Verity’s Brow. <br><br>
                    It does not inherit the Grenade energy gained from elemental weapon final blows, nor does it inherit the boost to allies’ Grenade regeneration upon throwing a Grenade with Death Throes active.
