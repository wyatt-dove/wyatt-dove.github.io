                    When the wielder obtains <b>elemental Weapon final blows</b> that match the element of the equipped Super Ability (i.e. a Void-elemental Weapon final blow with the Void Super Twilight Arsenal equipped), a <b>burst of healing</b> is created centered around the wielder. 
                    This burst of healing grants the Solar-elemental buff <b>Restoration</b> to the wielder and all allies within 15 meters for <b>3 seconds.</b> There is a 3 second cooldown between activations of this healing burst.<br><br>

                    While Restoration is active, health will consistently regenerate at a rate of 35 health per second, and this regeneration will not be halted by incoming damage.
