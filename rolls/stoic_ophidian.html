            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Synthoceps. While Prismatic Titan, being very Melee-centered, benefits significantly from Spirit of 
                Synthoceps, the Handling bonus provided by Spirit of the Ophidian to all Weapons serves only as a convenience factor in the majority of situations. As a result, 
                the only perk serving to provide a boost in this combination is Spirit of Synthoceps. Due to the lack of synergy and utility of Spirit of the Ophidian, this 
                combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps, providing a sharp boost in its damage output.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater provides a potent Super Ability damage bonus that is 
                not traditionally accessible to Titans. Due to this, any combination with Spirit of the Star-Eater provides inherent powerful utility. However, Spirit of the Ophidian 
                leaves much to be desired, as its Handling boost is exceptionally weak and negligible in practice This combination is placed in the C tier solely for the power boost 
                provided by Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While ineffective in most content, this combination may be worth having one copy of for very specific Raid Boss Damage setups, such as those that require activation of Bait and Switch.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!--Ophidian / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of Verity provides a strong boost to Grenade Ability damage if its effect can be 
                maintained through elemental Weapon final blows. However, the Grenades accessible to Prismatic Titan do not feature high damage output or intrinsic uptime, 
                meaning this effect will have high downtime and little practical impact in practice. Furthermore, Spirit of the Ophidian serves only to boost Handling speeds of 
                Weapons, and serves as a convenience factor. Due to the lack of synergy and utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Contact[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Contact</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Spirit of Contact</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Contact. While Spirit of Contact is a desirable Melee-boosting perk on its own, Spirit of the Ophidian 
                provides a weak Handling boost effect to all Weapons, offering no synergy with Spirit of Contact. It is more recommended to utilize a first-column perk that 
                synergizes with Spirit of Contact in some form to further enhance the offensive utility it provides. Due to the lack of synergy and overall weak effect provided by 
                Spirit of the Ophidian, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Scars[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Scars</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Scars. However, Spirit of Scars provides a potent defensive utility boost in the form of Restoration 
                upon Weapon final blows that match the equipped Super Ability element. As a source of healing, Restoration is one of the most powerful effects in the game. 
                Unfortunately, Spirit of the Ophidian provides a Handling boost that is negligible in the majority of situations, severely limiting the utility of this combination. 
                Due to the lack of synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the C tier solely for the powerful healing effect provided by Spirit of Scars.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This combination may see more use within a PvP environment, where passive effects such as these are more beneficial as opposed to other effects which may be more difficult to activate or take advantage of.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Horn[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Horn</button>
        <div class="collcontent">

            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Spirit of the Horn</h4>
            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Horn. Furthermore, both effects provided by these perks are very weak in practice, with Spirit of 
                the Ophidian providing a negligible Handling boost to Weapons and Spirit of the Horn creating a Solar wave on Barricade use that requires an enemy to be completely 
                stationary to gain full benefits from. Additionally, Spirit of the Horn provides no benefits with the Thruster Class Ability, further restricting its utility. Due 
                to the lack of synergy and complete lack of utility in most forms, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Alpha Lupi[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Alpha Lupi</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Spirit of Alpha Lupi</h4>
            <h5>"Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Alpha Lupi. Furthermore, both effects provided by this combination are weak in practice. Spirit of the 
                Ophidian provides a Handling boost to all Weapons, which serves only as a convenience factor in most situations. Spirit of Alpha Lupi provides a weak heal effect 
                upon casting a Barricade, which is unreliable as a form of defensive utility and also has no effect with the Thruster Class Ability. Due to the lack of synergy and 
                utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Alpha Lupi requires either Towering or Rally Barricade. It provides no effect with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This combination may see more use within a PvP environment, where passive effects such as these are more beneficial as opposed to other effects which may be more difficult to activate or take advantage of.</p>
                </li>

        <!--Ophidian / Armamentarium[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/armamentarium.png"></img>Armamentarium</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/armamentarium.png"></img>Spirit of the Armamentarium</h4>
            <h5>"Gain an additional grenade charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Armamentarium. While the bonus Grenade charge provided by Spirit of the Armamentarium can be useful, 
                it requires a more tailored setup to take full advantage of, which Spirit of the Ophidian serves no purpose in supplementing. Due to the inherent lack of Grenade 
                boosts present for Prismatic Titans, this combination sees very little practical utility. However, an additional Grenade charge is never a harmful effect, so this 
                combination may see a small amount of utility in that regard. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for two uses of the Unbreakable Aspect if Grenade energy is managed correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This combination may see more use within a PvP environment, where passive effects such as these are more beneficial as opposed to other effects which may be more difficult to activate or take advantage of.</p>
