            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A synergy exists between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Synthoceps provides a potent Melee damage bonus. Upon striking a higher-tier 
                enemy with a Melee Ability, Spirit of the Foetracer will provide a boost to elemental Weapon damage that matches the Ability. This combination serves to both 
                boost Melee Ability damage and Weapon damage. Spirit of Foetracer is also not exclusive to Melee Abilities, since it activates on any Ability damage. This allows 
                for high uptime on the Weapon damage boost effect as well as gaining the benefits of Spirit of Synthoceps simultaneously. Due to the synergy present in this 
                combination, it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match your Weapon elements with the element of the equipped Melee Ability, since it will be the most commonly used Ability for activating both Spirit effects.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A synergy exists between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of the Star-Eater. In addition to its potent Super damage boost, Spirit of the Star-Eater will directly 
                activate Spirit of the Foetracer when the player damages a higher-tier enemy with a Super Ability, providing the matching elemental Weapon boost. This combination 
                is especially strong in Boss damage situations, such as those present in Raids. Spirit of the Foetracer can also activate on any Ability damage, potentially allowing 
                for high uptime outside of the Super Ability as well. Due to the strong synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>With this combination, it is recommended to match your equipped Heavy Weapon's element to that of your Super Ability, since you will likely be using both in combination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>

            <h5>"Damaging a powerful combatant or Guardian with an ability grants you a temporary damage bonus for weapons matching that ability's element."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A notable synergy is present between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of Verity. Both perks require matching the element of an Ability to the element of an equipped 
                Weapon. Spirit of the Foetracer provides an elemental Weapon damage boost from dealing matching elemental Ability damage, while Spirit of Verity provides a Grenade 
                damage boost from obtaining matching elemental Weapon final blows. In this way, both perks feed into each other as long as enemy targets are present. The only 
                drawback of this combination is the lack of intrinsic Grenade Ability energy generation, which will need to be supplemented through external sources. Due to the 
                strong partially self-sustaining synergy present in this combination, it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Both Grapple Melee and the unique Grenade Ability granted by the Gunpowder Gamble Aspect are boosted by Spirit of Verity and will activate Spirit of the Foetracer upon dealing damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenadeâ€™s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A minor, indirect synergy is present between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Upon activating a Grenade Ability, Spirit of the Cyrtarachne 
                will grant Woven Mail, a powerful defensive effect. If this Grenade Ability damages a higher-tier enemy target, Spirit of the Foetracer will grant a matching 
                elemental Weapon damage boost. In this way, both effects will activate from the use of a Grenade Ability, with Spirit of the Foetracer gaining additional 
                benefits from the other equipped Abilities. However, neither perk supplements any Ability energy regeneration, requiring external sources of regeneration 
                to maintain high uptime. Due to the minor synergy present in the combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability will activate both Spirit of the Cyrtarachne and Spirit of the Foetracer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate Spirit of the Foetracer upon dealing damage.</p>
                </li>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Spirit of the Gyrfalcon</h4>
            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A synergy is present between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. Due to the high uptime of Invisibility effects intrinsic to Prismatic Hunter, 
                Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will see high uptime on its Volatile Rounds effect with no supplementation needed. Spirit of the Foetracer will grant an elemental 
                Weapon damage boost upon dealing damage with a matching Ability to a higher-ranking enemy target. These two perks can work in combination if using a Void-elemental 
                Ability, boosting Void weapon damage as well as allowing Void weapons to inflict Volatile. However, if the player is not using a Void Weapon or a Void Ability, 
                the power provided by this combination is significantly reduced, as it is heavily centered around Void-elemental damage. Additionally, maintaining the uptime of 
                both effects simultaneously may be difficult depending on the difficulty of the content. While the effect is powerful, the restrictions set by this combination 
                place it in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Stylish Executioner Aspect is highly recommended to achieve high Invisibility uptime and therefore high uptime on Spirit of the Gyrfalcon.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of the Liar. Spirit of the Foetracer motivates the use of Weapons after dealing Ability damage, 
                while Spirit of the Liar motivates consistent usage of Melee Abilities and attacks to utilize the unique Melee attack. While both perks provide strong utility on 
                their own, they will often work against each other in practice â€“ maintaining uptime of one will often sacrifice the uptime of the other. Both perks have much more 
                synergistic perk pairings available. Due to the lack of synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liarâ€™s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate Spirit of the Liar, allowing the player to follow up with the unique Melee Ability.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of the Wormhusk. While the Weapon damage boost provided by Spirit of the Foetracer is potent, 
                the defensive utility offered by Spirit of the Wormhusk is weak and unreliable in the majority of situations. This combination will only provide the benefits of 
                Spirit of the Foetracer, which has better synergy with almost every other second-column perk available. It will likely be more beneficial to use the Foetracer 
                Exotic Helmet instead, due to the weak nature of this combination. Due to the lack of synergy and weak effect granted by Spirit of the Wormhusk, this combination is 
                placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Wormhusk will only activate upon using a Dodge Ability. The Ascension Aspect will consume Class Ability energy without providing the heal effect.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A notable synergy exists between Spirit of the Foetracer and Spirit of the Coyote. In combination with the Gamblerâ€™s Dodge Class Ability, Spirit of the Coyoteâ€™s 
                additional Class Ability charge will also allow for high Melee Ability uptime. As a result, this will allow for higher Spirit of the Foetracer uptime, since it 
                requires Ability damage to gain the effect. The low base cooldown of Gamblerâ€™s Dodge will allow for much higher uptime on the elemental Weapon damage boost effect 
                from Foetracer compared to other options, making this a potent combination for Weapon-oriented setups. While there are objectively stronger options, this combination 
                has high accessibility and ease-of-use due to the passive nature of its synergy. For this reason, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If using the Gamblerâ€™s Dodge Class Ability, Spirit of the Coyote indirectly allows for substantially increased Melee Ability uptime as well, since Gamblerâ€™s Dodge instantly refunds a Melee Ability on cast. This further serves to increase the uptime of Spirit of the Foetracer, if the player is using matching-element Weapons.</p>
