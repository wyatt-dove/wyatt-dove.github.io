            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Synthoceps provides a powerful damage bonus to all Melee Abilities while 
                the user is surrounded by at least 3 enemies. Spirit of Inmost Light allows for very high uptime of these Melee Abilities, alongside the Grenade and Class Abilities. 
                In combination with the Gambler’s Dodge Class Ability, this combination allows for very high uptime of incredibly potent Melee Abilities, with the only restriction 
                being the need for nearby enemies. With the incredibly powerful synergy present between both perks in this combination, it is placed firmly in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. Not only will this deal massive damage to multiple enemies at once, but it will activate Spirit of Inmost Light multiple times, allowing for even higher uptime on its Ability regeneration effect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Grapple Melee is also boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Inmost Light / Star-Eater[1]-->

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Star-Eater, both perks are incredibly powerful on their own and offer high returns 
                with very little risk or effort. Spirit of Inmost Light allows for high general Ability uptime, while Spirit of the Star-Eater dramatically boosts the effectiveness 
                of the equipped Super Ability. Both perks in this combination can stand on their own as powerful. Combined with the sheer ease-of-use for disproportionately high 
                returns, this combination is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. This will activate Spirit of Inmost Light for each enemy struck by the Ability, often immediately granting the highest benefit to energy regeneration of the Grenade and Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to use “Firepower” or “Heavy Handed” Armor Mods, as these will utilize your high-uptime Grenade and Melee Abilities respectively to generate more Orbs of Power for Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!--Inmost Light / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>This perk combination boasts a powerful synergy in lower to mid-tier content, where defeating enemies with your weapons to maintain Verity’s buff is much more easy 
                to accomplish. Inmost Light will aid in maintaining high uptime on your Grenade Ability, while Verity will supply a hefty damage boost to your Grenade Ability if 
                you can maintain it. The only issue that arises is balancing using your Abilities to maintain the regeneration boost of Inmost Light while also obtaining Weapon 
                kills to maintain the damage boost of Verity. Losing either of these buffs can hurt the performance of this roll, but maintaining both can lead to very high uptime 
                of potent Grenade Abilities. However, the Grenade abilities that Hunters have access to are quite potent, making Spirit of Verity often worth maintaining. 
                For this reason it is in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee damage and the unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability are both boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. This will activate Spirit of Inmost Light for each enemy struck by the Ability, often immediately granting the highest benefit to energy regeneration of the Grenade and Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Inmost Light / Cyrtarachne[1]-->

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Spirit of the Cyrtarachne</h4>
            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>This perk combination boasts powerful offensive and defensive utility. Spirit of Inmost Light allows for high general Ability uptime, while Spirit of the Cyrtarachne 
                will provide the user with Woven Mail upon activating any Grenade Ability. Woven Mail is one of the strongest sources of damage resistance, so having an easily 
                accessible source of Woven Mail dramatically boosts general survivability across all content in the game. The high offensive output allowed by high Ability uptime 
                combined with the powerful defensive utility of Woven Mail places this combination in the A tier as a powerful general-use combination.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Activating the unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability activates the Woven Mail effect of Spirit of the Cyrtarachne as well as the improved Ability regeneration of Spirit of Inmost Light, making this Aspect a powerful choice for this combination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. This will activate Spirit of Inmost Light for each enemy struck by the Ability, often immediately granting the highest benefit to energy regeneration of the Grenade and Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Inmost Light / Gyrfalcon[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Gyrfalcon</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Spirit of the Gyrfalcon</h4>
            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no direct synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon, both perks provide powerful boosts independently of each other. 
                Spirit of Inmost Light ensures high general Ability uptime, while Spirit of the Gyrfalcon grants consistent access to Volatile Rounds for Void-elemental Weapons, 
                provided the player has reliable access to the Void Invisibility effect (i.e. from the Stylish Executioner Aspect). If the player can take advantage of both effects, 
                then this combination is extremely potent in the vast majority of content while also being very easy to use. For these reasons, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. This will activate Spirit of Inmost Light for each enemy struck by the Ability, often immediately granting the highest benefit to energy regeneration of the Grenade and Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Inmost Light / Liar[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Liar</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Spirit of the Liar</h4>
            <h5>"Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful Arc melee counterpunch."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>This combination boasts a powerful offensive synergy. Spirit of Inmost Light ensures high general Ability uptime, while Spirit of the Liar allows access to an 
                extremely powerful unique Melee attack. If this combination can be exploited to its full potential, it can produce extremely high damage output solely from the 
                player’s Abilities. However, this generally requires the player to both use certain Melee Abilities and Aspects as well as be within Melee range of enemies, 
                which both place restrictions on the player. Due to the sheer potential power of this combination, it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Combination Blow Melee Ability is recommended, since it will commonly flow naturally into the unique Melee attack provided by Spirit of the Liar. Combination Blow also synergizes well with other Prismatic Hunter Abilities, including the Gambler’s Dodge Class Ability and Winter’s Shroud Aspect. Additionally, each successful hit with Combination Blow will activate Spirit of Inmost Light’s effect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since this roll promotes an aggressive playstyle, it is recommended to utilize defensive utility in more difficult content, such as Invisibility from the Stylish Executioner Aspect.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/wormhusk.png"></img>Spirit of the Wormhusk</h4>
            <h5>"Dodging gives a small health and shield bump."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While a synergy does exist between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Wormhusk, it is significantly weaker than many other accessible combinations. Spirit of 
                Inmost Light allows for high general ability uptime, including the Class Ability which Spirit of the Wormhusk requires. However, the heal effect provided by Spirit 
                of the Wormhusk is incredibly weak, and often will be insufficient to save the player from a dangerous situation if they require a healing effect. The only source 
                of measurable power this combination provides comes from the Ability uptime provided by Spirit of Inmost Light, which has far superior combinations. Due to the weak 
                nature of Spirit of the Wormhusk, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>This roll may be desirable for PvP environments, where the passive effects provided may be more useful than other effects which are more difficult to activate and take advantage of.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. This will activate Spirit of Inmost Light for each enemy struck by the Ability, often immediately granting the highest benefit to energy regeneration of the Grenade and Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Inmost Light / Coyote[1]-->

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/coyote.png"></img>Spirit of the Coyote</h4>
            <h5>"Gain an additional class ability charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An implicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Coyote. Spirit of Inmost Light grants increased Ability regeneration upon using any 
                Ability, and Spirit of the Coyote grants an additional Class Ability charge, allowing the player to store up to two at any time. This effect does serve to increase 
                Spirit of Inmost Light’s Ability regeneration uptime by allowing the Class Ability to regenerate beyond the normal one charge. While effective, this combination 
                lacks the more potent synergy boasted by other rolls with Spirit of Inmost Light. For this reason, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If using the Gambler’s Dodge Class Ability, Spirit of the Coyote indirectly allows for substantially increased Melee Ability uptime as well, since Gambler’s Dodge instantly refunds a Melee Ability on cast. This further serves to increase the uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can strike multiple targets are recommended, such as the Threaded Spike. This will activate Spirit of Inmost Light for each enemy struck by the Ability, often immediately granting the highest benefit to energy regeneration of the Grenade and Class Ability.</p>
