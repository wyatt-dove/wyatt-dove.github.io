        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A strong explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Synthoceps. The potent Melee damage boost provided by Spirit of Synthoceps can be 
                used to easily access the Invisibility effect provided by Spirit of the Assassin. Both perks work in unison to provide both strong offensive and defensive utility, 
                allowing this combination to be effective in all content in the game. Due to the strong synergy provided by this combination which requires very little effort from 
                the player, it is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will both inherit the damage boost from Spirit of Synthoceps as well as activate the Invisibility effect from Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Star-Eater. Without an additional perk to take advantage of Spirit of the Assassin, it is a fairly weak effect on its own. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater is 
                an incredibly potent boost to Super Damage, which makes it worth using on its own in most cases. The defensive utility from Spirit of the Assassin can balance out the offensive 
                utility provided by Spirit of the Star-Eater to produce a generally powerful combination that functions well in most content in the game, only losing power in more difficult 
                content due to Melee ability final blows being slightly harder to obtain. Due to the ability for Spirit of the Star-Eater to stand on its own as well as the slight defensive 
                utility provided by Spirit of the Assassin, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate the Invisibility effect from Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Assassin / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Assassin provides Invisibility on powered Melee final blows, while 
                Spirit of Verity requires consistent final blows with elemental Weapons to maintain a Grenade damage boost. In this way, these two perks may actually work against 
                each other in practice, since utilizing your weapons to maintain Spirit of Verity will break any Invisibility. Both perks in this combination have far more effective 
                pairings which provide direct synergy. Spirit of Verity will encounter Grenade energy problems if the user does not supplement this in another way. Due to the lack 
                of explicit synergy and the relative inability for the perks to perform well on their own, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee is both boosted by Spirit of Verity and will activate the Invisibility effect of Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Cyrtarachne[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Cyrtarachne</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Spirit of the Cyrtarachne</h4>
            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Both perks aim to provide defensive utility in the form of Invisibility on 
                powered Melee final blow from Spirit of the Assassin and Woven Mail on Grenade Ability usage from Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. This leads to a shortage of offensive 
                utility, which will hinder this combination’s effectiveness in moderate to high difficulty content. Both perks have potential to be powerful, but only in combination 
                with a different perk which can expand upon the defensive utility that they provide. Due to the lack of inherent synergy and offensive utility, this combination is 
                placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Upon activating the Grapple Grenade Ability, Spirit of the Cyrtarachne will grant Woven Mail. Grapple Melee final blows will also activate Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability will grant Woven Mail similarly to a normal Grenade Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Gyrfalcon[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Gyrfalcon</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Spirit of the Gyrfalcon</h4>
            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. Exiting the Invisibility provided by Spirit of the Assassin will activate Spirit 
                of the Gyrfalcon, providing Volatile Rounds to Void-elemental Weapons. Due to a Hunter’s ability to maintain high Melee Ability uptime when combined with Gambler’s 
                Dodge alongside the other sources of Invisibility accessible to them, this will lead to extremely high uptime of Volatile Rounds. However, Invisibility is highly 
                accessible through the Stylish Executioner Aspect in the first place, which can lead to Spirit of the Assassin being redundant. If the player wishes to use a setup 
                without Stylish Executioner, however, this combination will see increased effectiveness. Due to the strong potential synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate the Invisibility effect from Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Liar[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Liar</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Spirit of the Liar</h4>
            <h5>"Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful Arc melee counterpunch."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A strong, explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Liar, especially if combined with the Stylish Executioner Aspect. Spirit of the 
                Assassin provides Invisibility on powered Melee final blows, while Spirit of the Liar allows access to a unique follow-up Melee attack upon hitting an enemy with 
                any Melee. This combination emphasizes a Melee-oriented setup, with Spirit of the Assassin providing defensive utility in the form of Invisibility and Spirit of the 
                Liar providing offensive utility with its unique Melee attack. This combination enhances one of the strongest setups available to the Prismatic Hunter, centering 
                around Melee Abilities. Due to the strong synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liar’s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate the Invisibility effect from Spirit of the Assassin and the unique Melee attack provided by Spirit of the Liar.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Wormhusk[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/wormhusk.png"></img>Wormhusk</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/wormhusk.png"></img>Spirit of the Wormhusk</h4>
            <h5>"Dodging gives a small health and shield bump."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Wormhusk. Both perks aim to provide defensive utility, with Spirit of the Assassin providing 
                Invisibility and Spirit of the Wormhusk providing a minor heal effect upon activating a Dodge Ability. There is a noticeable lack of offensive utility offered by 
                this combination. Combined with the extremely weak heal effect provided by Spirit of the Wormhusk, this combination falls far behind the vast majority of other 
                options. Due to the lack of synergy and offensive utility, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate the Invisibility effect from Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Coyote[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/coyote.png"></img>Coyote</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/coyote.png"></img>Spirit of the Coyote</h4>
            <h5>"Gain an additional class ability charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A minor implicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Coyote. The additional Class Ability charge granted by Spirit of the Coyote can be 
                used in combination with Gambler’s Dodge to provide higher uptime on Melee Abilities, which can supplement the uptime of Spirit of the Assassin. While this synergy 
                provides strong defensive utility, its offensive utility is determined by the power of the Melee Ability chosen by the player. Due to the high Melee Ability and 
                Invisibility uptime allowed by this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If using the Gambler’s Dodge Class Ability, Spirit of the Coyote indirectly allows for substantially increased Melee Ability uptime as well, since Gambler’s Dodge instantly refunds a Melee Ability on cast. This further serves to increase the uptime of Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate the Invisibility effect from Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
