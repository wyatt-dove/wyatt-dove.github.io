            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of Synthoceps, both perks are rather useful on their own. Synthoceps provides a powerful Melee 
                damage boost, which can be exploited further through the Warlock’s Incinerator Snap Ignition damage. The Stag provides an extra source of defensive utility while 
                using either of the Rift Abilities. However, Spirit of the Stag provides no passive boost to Rift energy regeneration, and it provides no benefit if used alongside 
                Phoenix Dive. Due to the restrictions imposed by Spirit of the Stag and the lack of synergy between both perks, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Incinerator Snap Melee Ability is recommended, since it is commonly used at a range where Spirit of Synthoceps would be active. Additionally, the Ignition it creates also inherits the damage boost from Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Stag does not inherit the Rift regeneration effect from its parent Exotic. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Rift is placed inside an ally's Well of Radiance, the damage resistance effects will stack on top of each other, providing a stronger benefit.</p>
                </li>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater is an extremely potent effect that the Warlock 
                does not typically have access to. It is a very powerful perk on its own irrespective of the perk in the first column. It is fairly straightforward to achieve the 
                maximum benefit of Star Eater, massively boosting the damage output of the player’s Super Abilities. While Spirit of the Stag does provide defensive utility while 
                in a Rift, it does not provide any Rift regeneration effects, nor does it function with Phoenix Dive. The uptime of the damage resistance effect will be low as a 
                result, and Star-Eater will only function when the player uses their Super Ability. However, since Star-Eater is an incredibly potent effect on its own, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Super Ability options for pairing with Spirit of the Star-Eater are Song of Flame for sustained damage and Nova Bomb for quick burst damage. Needlestorm is not recommended since only the initial impact of the needles is buffed by the Star-Eater damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Stag does not inherit the Rift regeneration effect from its parent Exotic. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Rift is placed inside an ally's Well of Radiance, the damage resistance effects will stack on top of each other, providing a stronger benefit.</p>

        <!--Stag / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stag.png"></img>Stag + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of Verity. However, Spirit of Verity provides a very potent boost to Grenade damage if maintained 
                properly and used alongside powerful Grenade Abilities. It provides no passive Grenade Ability energy regeneration, however, the Warlock has access to the Feed the 
                Void Aspect which makes up for this drawback while also synergizing with the final blows necessary for Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Stag provides a moderate 
                defensive boost while standing in a Rift, but provides no Rift regeneration effects nor does it have any function at all with Phoenix Dive. The lack of synergy 
                between the perks alongside the overall weak nature of Spirit of the Stag places this combination in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to use high-damage potential Grenade Abilities with Spirit of Verity. These include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades on Warlock. Coldsnap and Healing Grenades gain little to no benefit, making the majority of the power from this combination irrelevant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Stag does not inherit the Rift regeneration effect from its parent Exotic. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Rift is placed inside an ally's Well of Radiance, the damage resistance effects will stack on top of each other, providing a stronger benefit.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stag.png"></img>Spirit of the Stag</h4>
            <h5>"Your Rift provides damage reduction to allies standing in it."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Spirit of Vesper</h4>
            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is an explicit synergy between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of Vesper. Since Spirit of Vesper requires you to place a Rift near enemies to utilize the 
                shockwaves, Spirit of the Stag will be immensely useful for the damage resistance it provides while standing in the Rift. The combined defensive utility alongside 
                the ability to use a traditionally defensive Ability for offensive purposes provides a unique and powerful combination in many aspects of the game. However, neither 
                perk in this combination provides any boost to Class Ability regeneration, nor do either of them have any function with Phoenix Dive. Additionally, the player may 
                find that both the damage resistance and the shockwave effects are insufficient against more difficult enemies in higher-tier content. For these reasons, 
                this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Use of the Healing Rift is strongly recommended as opposed to the Empowering Rift. The healing effect combined with the damage resistance of Spirit of the Stag allows the user to absorb much more damage than usual.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since neither Spirit of the Stag nor Spirit of Vesper inherit the Rift regeneration effect from their parent Exotics. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Rift is placed inside an ally's Well of Radiance, the damage resistance effects will stack on top of each other, providing a stronger benefit.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of Harmony. However, Spirit of Harmony provides a very potent Super Ability regeneration effect that 
                is nearly universally powerful in any combination, regardless of the perk in the first column. The perk is straightforward to activate and provides a powerful boost 
                in any content. However, Spirit of the Stag has restrictions in place that prevent it from being universally applicable. It has no function with Phoenix Dive, nor 
                does it provide any Class Ability regeneration. Due to the lack of synergy between the perks and the restrictions in place by Spirit of the Stag, this 
                combination is placed in the C tier solely for the utility of Spirit of Harmony.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Stag does not inherit the Rift regeneration effect from its parent Exotic. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Rift is placed inside an ally's Well of Radiance, the damage resistance effects will stack on top of each other, providing a stronger benefit.</p>

            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A very notable synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of Starfire. Spirit of Starfire requires the use of an Empowering Rift, which provides no 
                defensive utility at base. Spirit of the Stag augments this Rift to provide a damage resistance effect, which will prove to be very potent when combined with 
                external sources of healing or damage resistance. This alleviates one major downside of Spirit of Starfire – the need for the player to place themselves in danger 
                to exploit the Grenade regeneration effect. However, Spirit of Starfire on its own has a comparatively weak regeneration effect. While this perk combination exhibits 
                direct synergy and functions well in most content, there will always be potential upgrades to seek. Therefore, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Feed the Void Aspect will not only provide a powerful healing effect through Devour, but will also provide additional supplementary Grenade Ability generation. This provides the extra health sustain needed to fully take advantage of Spirit of Starfire.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since neither Spirit of the Stag nor Spirit of Starfire inherit the Rift regeneration effect from their parent Exotics. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Rift is placed inside an ally's Well of Radiance, the damage resistance effects will stack on top of each other, providing a stronger benefit. The damage boost of Empowering Rift will not stack, however.</p>

            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of the Swarm. Both effects have a use on their own, but they are intended to be supplementary boosts 
                to a potentially more powerful perk in the opposite column. Spirit of the Stag provides a useful damage resistance effect while in a Rift, but has no benefit with 
                Phoenix Dive nor does it provide any Class Ability regeneration effects. Spirit of the Swarm will output passive damage through the Threadlings it creates from 
                Tangles. However, on its own, this is not an inherently potent Ability. There are ways to bring out the potential power of this perk, however, by ensuring the player 
                has additional sources of Threadlings to supplement the Threadling generation. Due to the lack of explicit synergy and relative lack of power across both perks, this 
                combination is placed in the C tier due to the potential utility of Spirit of the Swarm.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to either use the Arcane Needle Melee Ability or the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Awakening in combination with a Strand-elemental Weapon. These will ensure that the player is making as many Tangles as possible to source Threadlings from.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player has acquired the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, Spirit of the Swarm is a very popular choice to help maintain uptime on the Spindle damage boost. If the player is using this in more difficult content, then the damage resistance provided by Spirit of the Stag may be useful.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Stag does not inherit the Rift regeneration effect from its parent Exotic. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Stag and Spirit of the Claw. Both perks provide passive boosts to one Ability, while providing no source of energy regeneration 
                for either ability. Spirit of the Claw is intended to be a supplementary boost to the perk in the first column, while Spirit of the Stag is intended to provide a 
                utility defensive boost. Both perks provide a beneficial effect, but they do not synergize in a way that allows for a greater power boost to be obtained as opposed 
                to other perk options in either column. Due to the lack of synergy and inherently weak effects, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
