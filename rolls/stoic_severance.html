        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Synthoceps</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of Synthoceps. The Melee damage boost provided by Spirit of Synthoceps allows much easier access to 
                Spirit of Severance’s damaging explosions. This allows for more area-of-effect coverage from Melee Abilities. It is worth noting that there is a short cooldown on 
                how quickly the player can trigger these explosions, which may interfere with a Melee-focused setup. Due to the strong inherent synergy present in this combination, 
                it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps, providing a sharp boost in its damage output.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Severance / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of the Star-Eater, the latter perk is a potent Super Ability-boosting effect that is not traditionally 
                accessible to Titans, making any roll featuring it a strong combination. Spirit of Severance provides additional offensive utility to Melee Abilities, which the 
                Prismatic Titan specializes in. Spirit of Severance may only begin to struggle in more difficult content, but the innate power of Titan Melee Abilities can supplement 
                this. The result is a potent combination of offensive utility from both Melee and Super Abilities. Due to the versatile offensive utility provided by this 
                combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Severance promotes a Melee-focused setup, it is recommended to use mods such as Heavy Handed or Hands-On to form a minor synergy between the two perks in this combination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!--Severance / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of Verity, since both perks serve to enhance different Abilities. Spirit of Severance augments Melee 
                Abilities with additional explosions on final blows, and Spirit of Verity provides a Grenade damage bonus. While both effects can be useful, it is commonly better to 
                pair them with a synergistic perk rather than attempting to enhance multiple Abilities at once. Spirit of Verity will also see low uptime, since Titans have very 
                little way of supplementing Grenade energy as opposed to Melee energy. Due to the lack of synergy present in this combination, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Severance / Contact[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Contact</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Spirit of Contact</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A strong synergy is present between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of Contact, as both serve to augment Melee Abilities with additional offensive utility. Spirit of 
                Severance allows for increased area coverage upon powered Melee final blows, while Spirit of Contact incurs Jolting lightning strikes upon dealing powered Melee 
                damage. The resulting Melee Abilities are quite powerful due to the number of effects they can trigger alongside Prismatic Titan’s inherent affinity for Melee 
                Abilities. Due to the presence of a strong synergy, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Severance / Scars[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Scars</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of Scars. However, Spirit of Severance supplements Melee Abilities with additional area coverage through its 
                explosion effects, and Spirit of Scars provides access to Restoration, a powerful healing effect. This combination will provide a mixture of offensive and defensive 
                utility, with Spirit of Severance only potentially becoming less impactful in more difficult content. Furthermore, Spirit of Severance promotes a Melee-oriented 
                setup, while Spirit of Scars promotes frequent Weapon usage to maintain the Restoration effect. Due to the lack of synergy but strong effects offered independently 
                from the perks, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Severance / Horn[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Horn</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Spirit of the Horn</h4>
            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of the Horn. While Spirit of Severance may provide useful offensive utility with its explosion effects, 
                Spirit of the Horn neither supplements this effect nor offers significant utility on its own. Spirit of the Horn additionally requires the use of a Barricade, as 
                it has no effect with the Thruster Class Ability. The result is a combination that lacks overall offensive utility alongside providing no defensive utility at all. 
                Due to the lack of synergy and combined utility, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Severance / Alpha Lupi[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Severance + <img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Alpha Lupi</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/severance.png"></img>Spirit of Severance</h4>
            <h5>"Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Spirit of Alpha Lupi</h4>
            <h5>"Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of Alpha Lupi. While Spirit of Severance may provide useful offensive utility with its explosion effects, 
                Spirit of Alpha Lupi provides weak and unreliable defensive utility in the form of its minor heal effect upon casting a Barricade, providing no benefit if used with 
                the Thruster Class Ability. Spirit of Severance may provide a desirable effect, but struggles to stand on its own without additional supplement from the perk it is 
                paired with. Due to the lack of synergy and combined utility, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Alpha Lupi requires either Towering or Rally Barricade. It provides no effect with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Severance / Armamentarium[1]-->

            <h5>"Gain an additional grenade charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Severance and Spirit of the Armamentarium. However, both effects provided are useful independently of each other. Spirit of 
                Severance enhances Melee Abilities with additional explosion effects, which is already the Prismatic Titan’s specialty. Additionally, the bonus Grenade charge 
                granted by Armamentarium does not have significant impact in practice, but is never a harmful effect to have and can allow for unique interactions. The result is 
                a combination that provides moderate utility for two separate Abilities, but may fall behind other specialized options. Due to the lack of synergy provided by this 
                combination, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for two uses of the Unbreakable Aspect if Grenade energy is managed correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consecration final blows will trigger Spirit of Severance.</p>
