        <!--Eternal Warrior / Synthoceps[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Synthoceps</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of Synthoceps. However, Prismatic Titan is Melee-focused by nature, so the potent damage buff 
                provided by Spirit of Synthoceps is universally applicable in all content in the game, making any combination featuring it worthwhile. Spirit of Eternal Warrior 
                grants a Super Element-matching Weapon Surge effect when the player’s Super expires, granting a period of boosted Weapon performance. While this does not have 
                high uptime or very potent utility, it can be useful against Boss targets which will survive the initial Super Ability. This combination is placed in the B tier 
                due to the offensive utility provided by Spirit of Synthoceps and the situational benefits gained from Spirit of the Eternal Warrior.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps, providing a sharp boost in its damage output.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Eternal Warrior / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of the Star-Eater. Spirit of the Star-Eater provides a potent Super damage boost that is not 
                normally accessible to Titans, while Spirit of the Eternal Warrior provides a matching element Weapon Surge after the Super expires, allowing for a short period of 
                boosted damage. This combination is most applicable for Boss targets with extremely high health that can survive a boosted Super Ability, which mostly applies to 
                Raid bosses. Outside of the Super Ability and the short duration following it, this combination provides no benefit, limiting its overall utility. Due to the 
                extreme power provided in a short burst window, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to use a different combination featuring Spirit of the Star-Eater that provides benefits outside of the Super Ability, then swap to this combination when the player wishes to use their Super. However, the Weapon Surge effect may not be desirable enough to warrant swapping during gameplay, and some content locks equipment swaps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Eternal Warrior / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of Verity. While the Weapon Surge effect granted by Spirit of the Eternal Warrior may 
                aid in maintaining Spirit of Verity uptime through final blows, this synergy has low uptime. Additionally, this combination will require matching Grenade, Super, 
                and Weapon elements to gain full effect, limiting the player’s options even further. Combined with the lack of Grenade energy regeneration effects, this combination 
                will see little benefit the majority of the time. Due to the lack of synergy and uptime offered by this combination, it is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Eternal Warrior / Contact[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Contact</button>
        <div class="collcontent">

            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Spirit of Contact</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of Contact. However, Spirit of Contact augments Melee Abilities with supplementary damage, which 
                is a powerful effect by itself. While Spirit of the Eternal Warrior will have low uptime, it can be utilized for its Weapon Surge effect against Boss targets that 
                Spirit of Contact will provide little aid in defeating. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Eternal Warrior / Scars[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Scars</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of Scars. While Spirit of Scars provides powerful defensive utility through its 
                Restoration effect, Spirit of the Eternal Warrior has low uptime on its offensive utility through its Weapon Surge effect. The overall offensive utility 
                provided by this combination will be lacking as a result. Due to the lack of synergy and resulting offensive utility, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Eternal Warrior / Horn[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Horn</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Spirit of the Horn</h4>
            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of the Horn. The offensive utility provided by Spirit of the Horn is weak in most situations, 
                struggling to make up for the low uptime of Spirit of the Eternal Warrior’s Weapon Surge effect. This combination will see low overall offensive output as a result, 
                and many other combinations would provide a more noticeable effect. Due to the lack of synergy and overall power output, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn provides no benefits with the Thruster Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Eternal Warrior / Alpha Lupi[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Eternal Warrior + <img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Alpha Lupi</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Spirit of Alpha Lupi</h4>
            <h5>"Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of Alpha Lupi. The minor heal effect provided by Spirit of Alpha Lupi is unreliable as a source of 
                defensive utility, and it requires the use of a Barricade instead of the Thruster Class Ability. Spirit of Eternal Warrior will see very low uptime on its offensive 
                utility, meaning this combination will provide negligible benefits the majority of the time. The lack of synergy combined with the weak effects and low uptime 
                provided by this combination place it in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Alpha Lupi provides no effect with the Thruster Class Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/eternalwarrior.png"></img>Spirit of the Eternal Warrior</h4>
            <h5>"Gain bonus damage for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/armamentarium.png"></img>Spirit of the Armamentarium</h4>
            <h5>"Gain an additional grenade charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Eternal Warrior and Spirit of the Armamentarium. While the Grenade charge granted by Spirit of the Armamentarium is a useful 
                supplementary effect, Spirit of the Eternal Warrior neither takes advantage of this nor provides a powerful effect with high enough uptime to improve the strength of 
                this combination. Both perks have far  more suitable perk combinations that synergize with each other. Due to the lack of overall synergy, this combination is placed 
                in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for two uses of the Unbreakable Aspect if Grenade energy is managed correctly.</p>
