            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A powerful synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Synthoceps. Prismatic Titan has access to many powerful Melee Abilities, which are further 
                improved by Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Inmost Light allows for even higher uptime on these Melee Abilities, working in combination to provide immense offensive 
                output that not even the highest-tier content can withstand. The sheer power and uptime provided by this combination places it in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps, providing a sharp boost in its damage output.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>

            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Star-Eater, both provide passive benefits that are incredibly potent. Spirit of 
                Inmost Light aids in general Ability uptime while Spirit of the Star-Eater, which is not typically accessible to Titans, provides a strong damage increase to Super 
                Abilities. This combination sees consistent effectiveness across all content in the game. The potent utility provided by this combination combined with its 
                ease-of-use places it in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to use “Firepower” or “Heavy Handed” Armor Mods, as these will utilize your high-uptime 
                        Grenade and Melee Abilities respectively to generate more Orbs of Power for Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Verity. The high Grenade Ability uptime provided by Spirit of Inmost Light combined with Spirit 
                of Verity’s Grenade damage boost allows for strong uptime on these boosted Grenades. However, the Grenades accessible to Prismatic Titan frequently do not boast the 
                highest damage profiles to begin with, and Spirit of Verity may be difficult to maintain in more difficult content. Prismatic Titan also features many Melee-focused 
                boosts, which have little benefit for Grenades. Due to the inherent synergy provided, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>

            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A powerful synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Contact. The high Ability uptime provided by Spirit of Inmost Light pairs exceptionally well 
                with Spirit of Contact, which creates lightning strikes upon powered Melee hits. The supplementary damage provided by the lightning strikes and the resulting Jolt 
                effects provides powerful offensive utility paired with any Melee Ability. It possesses less direct damage than other combinations, but provides exceptional 
                area-of-effect damage output as well as consistent damage over time options. Due to the powerful synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>

            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Scars, both perks provide powerful utility individually. Spirit of Inmost Light 
                provides high Ability uptime, while Spirit of Scars provide powerful defensive utility in the form of Restoration from Weapon final blows that match your Super 
                Ability’s element. This Restoration effect also applies to nearby allies. While not a directly offensively powerful synergy, this combination provides strong 
                utility that is usable in most content in the game. Due to the combined offensive and defensive utility, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Inmost Light / Horn[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Horn</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Spirit of the Horn</h4>
            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While an explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Horn, the overall offensive output provided is significantly weaker than other 
                options. Spirit of Inmost Light provides high Ability uptime, which feeds into Spirit of the Horn’s Solar blast upon casting a Barricade. Spirit of the Horn lacks 
                the raw offensive utility to be worth focusing a combination around, being usable in low-tier content and being borderline unusable in higher-tier content. Spirit 
                of the Horn also sees no benefit with the Thruster Class Ability, which is commonly used with Spirit of Inmost Light due to its lower base cooldown. Due to the lack 
                of offensive utility provided, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Spirit of Alpha Lupi</h4>
            <h5>"Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While an explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Alpha Lupi, the overall benefits gained from the combination does not compete with other 
                combinations utilizing Spirit of Inmost Light. The high Ability uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light feeds into the Barricades necessary for Spirit of Alpha Lupi’s heal 
                effect. However, this heal effect is weak and unreliable for defensive utility in most situations. Additionally, Spirit of Alpha Lupi provides no benefit with the 
                Thruster Class Ability, which is commonly used with Spirit of Inmost Light due to its lower base cooldown. Due to the overall weak nature of Spirit of Alpha Lupi, 
                this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Alpha Lupi requires either Towering or Rally Barricade. It provides no effect with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability.</p>
                </li>

            <h5>"Gain an additional grenade charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An indirect synergy exists between Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of the Armamentarium. The additional Grenade charge provided by Spirit of the Armamentarium serves to 
                boost the already high uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light, allowing for more consistent Ability usage. While this is not a directly potent effect on its own, it is extremely 
                accessible and does not lose effectiveness in any tier of difficulty. Spirit of the Armamentarium is a better pairing with Spirit of Inmost Light than many other potential 
                perks in the second column. Due to the very accessible synergy and general applicability, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for two uses of the Unbreakable Aspect if Grenade energy is managed correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Inmost Light benefits from multi-charge Abilities, such as the Frenzied Blade Melee Ability and the bonus Grenade charge granted by Spirit of the Armamentarium.</p>
