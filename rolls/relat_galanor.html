            <h5>"Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends."</h5>

            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of Synthoceps, both perks are potent as standalone effects. Spirit of Galanor allows for high Super 
                Ability uptime, while Spirit of Synthoceps provides a strong Melee damage boost. Due to the high innate uptime of Melee Abilities through the use of Gambler’s Dodge, 
                Spirit of Synthoceps will have relatively high uptime. The player will also be able to maintain very high Super Ability uptime assuming their chosen Super Ability is 
                capable of reaching the maximum refund provided by Spirit of Galanor. Due to both perks being potent as standalone options, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Galanor is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy. The least effective Super Ability is Golden Gun, which can only refund up to a quarter of the full Super Energy. All other Super Abilities will see varying refunds depending on the situation.</p>

            <h5>"Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An explicit and powerful synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of the Star-Eater. Spirit of Galanor provides extremely high uptime on Super Abilities, 
                and Spirit of the Star-Eater provides a powerful damage bonus to Super Abilities. The only restriction in place is the need to collect Orbs of Power before casting a 
                Super Ability, but Orbs of Power are very accessible and easy to generate. While this combination does not enhance any Ability outside of the Super Ability, its 
                effect is potent enough to be worth using in the majority of situations. For this reason, it is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Galanor is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy. The least effective Super Ability is Golden Gun, which can only refund up to a quarter of the full Super Energy. All other Super Abilities will see varying refunds depending on the situation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>

            <h5>"Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of Galanor provides high Super Ability uptime, while Spirit of Verity provides a 
                boost to Grenade damage. While the perks do not synergize together, Spirit of Galanor is a very potent effect by itself, and the damage bonus provided by Spirit of 
                Verity for Grenade Abilities is also very powerful if maintained properly. Since Spirit of Verity does not provide additional Grenade energy regeneration, it will 
                need to be supplemented from an external source. However, both perks separately boost a particular Ability to a noticeable degree in practice, despite the lack of 
                synergy. For this reason, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Both Grapple Melee and the unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability are boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Galanor is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy. The least effective Super Ability is Golden Gun, which can only refund up to a quarter of the full Super Energy. All other Super Abilities will see varying refunds depending on the situation.</p>

            <h5>"Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Spirit of the Cyrtarachne</h4>
            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Spirit of Galanor provides high Super Ability uptime, while Spirit of the 
                Cyrtarachne provides Woven Mail on Grenade Ability usage. While Woven Mail is a powerful defensive boost, Spirit of the Cyrtarachne does not inherently provide 
                high uptime for the effect since it offers no additional Grenade energy generation. However, if supplemented properly through external sources, this combination 
                can provide notable offensive utility through the Super Ability uptime as well as defensive utility through Woven Mail. For these reasons, despite the lack of 
                synergy, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Activating the unique Grenade Ability provided by the Gunpowder Gamble Aspect will activate Spirit of the Cyrtarachne.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Galanor is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy. The least effective Super Ability is Golden Gun, which can only refund up to a quarter of the full Super Energy. All other Super Abilities will see varying refunds depending on the situation.</p>

            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. However, due to Prismatic Hunter’s innate access to Invisibility effects, Spirit of 
                the Gyrfalcon will see high uptime of Volatile Rounds at base, providing a strong and consistent Weapon-oriented boost. Spirit of Galanor provides high Super Ability 
                uptime, which serves as a supplement to the offensive utility of this combination. While the perks do not directly synergize with each other, they separately provide 
                powerful offensive utility provided the player can take advantage of the Volatile Rounds. For this reason, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Galanor is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy. The least effective Super Ability is Golden Gun, which can only refund up to a quarter of the full Super Energy. All other Super Abilities will see varying refunds depending on the situation.</p>

            <h5>"Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful Arc melee counterpunch."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of the Liar. Spirit of Galanor improves Super Ability uptime while Spirit of the Liar allows the user 
                to use a unique Melee attack. While the two perks do not directly synergize, they separately provide useful offensive utility, only requiring the player to utilize 
                a Melee-oriented setup to fully benefit from Spirit of the Liar. Due to the general offensive utility this combination provides, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liar’s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate Spirit of the Liar, allowing the user to immediately use the unique Melee attack.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Galanor is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy.

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of the Wormhusk. While the Super Ability uptime provided by Spirit of Galanor is potent, the defensive utility 
                provided by Spirit of the Wormhusk is very weak and unreliable in most situations. This combination only serves to improve Super Ability uptime, as the heal effect 
                from Spirit of the Wormhusk will have negligible effect. Due to the lack of synergy and utility provided by Spirit of the Wormhusk, this combination is placed in 
                the D tier solely for Spirit of Galanor’s high Super Ability uptime.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Galanor and Spirit of the Coyote. However, both perks provide useful utility, with Spirit of Galanor providing very 
                high Super Ability uptime. Spirit of the Coyote only serves to provide an additional Class Ability charge, but the Hunter Class Abilities can be very versatile a
                nd powerful, making this a desirable passive effect on its own. Due to the utility separately offered by both perks, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The additional Class Ability charge provided by Spirit of the Coyote can also allow for high uptime on the Ascension and Threaded Specter Aspects.</p>
