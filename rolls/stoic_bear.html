        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Spirit of the Bear</h4>
            <h5>"Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of Synthoceps, as both provide benefits to different Abilities. Spirit of the Bear grants noticeable Super 
                energy refunds when using the Unbreakable Aspect, but Spirit of Synthoceps does not buff Unbreakable. Unbreakable will also see very low uptime unless Grenade energy 
                generation is supplemented externally, as Prismatic Titan focuses mainly on Melee damage output and uptime. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in 
                the C tier solely for the Super energy granted by Spirit of the Bear and the immensely powerful Melee damage buff provided by Spirit of Synthoceps. Its ranking is 
                subject to increase if the Unbreakable Aspect receives major changes.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps, providing a sharp boost in its damage output.</p>
                </li>

        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Bear + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Spirit of the Bear</h4>
            <h5>"Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A notable synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of the Star-Eater. Spirit of the Bear aims to provide high uptime on Super Abilities, which are buffed 
                immensely by Spirit of the Star-Eater, providing a reliable source of powerful damage output when used in combination. However, to achieve this high uptime, Grenade 
                energy will need to be supplemented somehow, since Spirit of the Bear provides no energy generation benefits by itself. Irrespective of Spirit of the Bear, Spirit of 
                the Star-Eater provides a powerful effect that is not traditionally accessible to Titans. Due to the powerful potential synergy provided, this combination is placed in the B tier. Its ranking is subject to increase if the Unbreakable Aspect receives major changes.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Spirit of the Bear</h4>
            <h5>"Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A synergy is present between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of Verity, with the Grenade damage boost provided by Spirit of Verity boosting the damage of Unbreakable. 
                This is a much needed damage boost in Unbreakable’s current state, and by using Unbreakable, general Super Ability uptime will increase as well due to Spirit of the 
                Bear. However, this combination lacks any form of Grenade energy generation effects, so this will need to be supplemented externally to achieve maximum benefits. 
                Due to the present synergy, this combination is placed in the B tier. Its ranking is subject to increase if the Unbreakable Aspect receives major changes.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Verity boosts Unbreakable’s damage, providing direct synergy with Spirit of the Bear since it requires the use of Unbreakable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>

        <!--Bear / Contact[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Bear + <img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Contact</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Spirit of the Bear</h4>
            <h5>"Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Spirit of Contact</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of Contact, since both perks provide benefits to separate abilities. While Spirit of Contact provides strong utility with its perk, Spirit of the Bear neither synergizes with it nor supplements its effects. However, if Grenade energy is supplemented in some form, then this combination will also see high Super Ability uptime, which is a strong benefit in any content. This combination is placed in the C tier due to the utility provided by the perks separately. Its ranking is subject to increase if the Unbreakable Aspect receives major changes.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>

        <!--Bear / Scars[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Bear + <img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Scars</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Spirit of the Bear</h4>
            <h5>"Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of Scars. Spirit of the Bear is centered around the use of Unbreakable, while Spirit of Scars requires 
                Weapon final blows. Leaning into the uptime of either effect requires sacrificing the uptime of the other effect. However, there are Weapons that can take advantage 
                of both of these perks, but this requires the player to be fortunate enough to have these Weapons in the first place. Notable weapons are listed in the Tips section. 
                Due to the ability for the two perks to synergize with specific weapons, this combination is placed in the C tier. Its ranking is subject to increase if the Unbreakable Aspect receives major changes.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that supplement Grenade energy generation will provide synergy between these perks. Weapons with the Demolitionist perk are the most applicable, with Wellspring and the Indomitability Origin Trait with certain supers also functioning well.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Bear / Horn[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Bear + <img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Horn</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Spirit of the Bear</h4>
            <h5>"Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Spirit of the Horn</h4>
            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of the Horn. Spirit of the Bear provides utility in the form of Super energy generation, but Spirit of the 
                Horn does not provide meaningful offensive utility to round out this combination. Spirit of the Horn also requires the use of a Barricade, locking the player out 
                from using the Thruster Class Ability. The combined lack of synergy and offensive utility of this combination places it in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Bear / Alpha Lupi[1]-->

            <h5>"Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of Alpha Lupi. Spirit of the Bear provides utility in the form of Super energy generation, but Spirit of Alpha 
                Lupi fails to provide any meaningful utility to supplement this. The heal effect on Barricade cast is not only unreliable as a form of defensive utility, but also 
                locks that player out from using the Thruster Class Ability, as it provides no benefits with Spirit of Alpha Lupi. The combined lack of synergy and utility provided 
                by this combination places it in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Bear / Armamentarium[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/bear.png"></img>Bear + <img class="icon" src="../icons/armamentarium.png"></img>Armamentarium</button>
        <div class="collcontent">

            <h5>"Gain an additional grenade charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Direct synergy exists between Spirit of the Bear and Spirit of the Armamentarium. Since Unbreakable uses Grenade energy, Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for up 
                to two uses of Unbreakable to be stored in reserve, assuming Grenade energy is managed properly. Not only does this boost uptime of Unbreakable, but it also allows 
                for quicker Super energy gains, subsequently boosting Super Ability uptime as a result. Due to the inherent synergy provided by this combination, it is placed in the 
                A tier. Its ranking is subject to increase further if the Unbreakable Aspect receives major changes.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If using Unbreakable with the second Grenade charge granted by Spirit of the Armamentarium, it must be released before Unbreakable begins consuming the first Grenade charge, or else both Grenade charges will be consumed for just one use of Unbreakable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Bear can grant up to a quarter of full Super energy at maximum potential per use of Unbreakable, allowing for potentially very high Super Ability uptime.</p>
