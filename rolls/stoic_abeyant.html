            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Spirit of the Abeyant</h4>
            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of Synthoceps, both effects provided are quite potent, provided the player is using the 
                Drengr’s Lash Aspect. Spirit of the Abeyant provides a powerful Suspend effect over a wide area, allowing for much safer usage of Melee Abilities boosted by Spirit 
                of Synthoceps. In this way, these perks can be used in combination rather fluidly. Due to the potency provided by each perk, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Suspend effect from Drengr’s Lash will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps, providing a sharp boost in its damage output.</p>
                </li>

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Spirit of the Abeyant</h4>
            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater provides a potent Super Ability damage boost that is 
                not traditionally accessible to Titans. Additionally, if utilized to its potential, Spirit of the Abeyant provides very strong defensive utility with its Suspend 
                effect over a wide area. This combination therefore provides a very defensive-focused utility with a sharp boost to offense upon using a Super Ability. Due to the 
                combined offensive and defensive utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Suspend effect from Drengr’s Lash will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Abeyant / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Abeyant + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Spirit of the Abeyant</h4>
            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Abeyant provides powerful defensive utility in the form of its Suspend effect over 
                a large area, meaning the only offensive utility is sourced from Spirit of Verity. Since Prismatic Titan emphasizes Melee performance instead of Grenades, Spirit of 
                Verity’s boost provides comparatively less significant boosts compared to a Melee-focused perk. Due to this, its performance falls behind other combinations featuring 
                Spirit of the Abeyant. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Suspend effect from Drengr’s Lash will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Abeyant / Contact[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Abeyant + <img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Contact</button>

            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Spirit of Contact</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of Contact. However, the powerful Suspend effect provided by Spirit of the Abeyant allows for much 
                safer usage of Melee Abilities, which are enhanced by Spirit of Contact. These perks can be used in combination in this manner, providing powerful combined offensive 
                and defensive utility in many situations. Due to the combined offensive and defensive utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Suspend effect from Drengr’s Lash will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>

        <!--Abeyant / Scars[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Abeyant + <img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Scars</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Spirit of the Abeyant</h4>
            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of Scars, both perks provide powerful sources of defensive utility in the form of Abeyant’s 
                Suspend effect and Scars’ Restoration effect. Due to Prismatic Titan’s inherent lack of defensive utility, a combination such as this may be useful if the player is 
                struggling to survive in difficult content, as Prismatic Titan  features powerful offensive utility by nature. Due to the powerful defensive utility provided by this 
                combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Suspend effect from Drengr’s Lash will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Abeyant / Horn[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Abeyant + <img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Horn</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Spirit of the Abeyant</h4>
            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/horn.png"></img>Spirit of the Horn</h4>
            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of the Horn, with both providing an effect upon casting a Barricade. The Suspend effect provided 
                by Spirit of the Abeyant may improve Spirit of the Horn’s Ability to hit targets repeatedly, triggering an Ignition. However, this effect may be unreliable and 
                provides no utility outside of casting a Barricade. Spirit of the Horn can be replaced for much more effective alternatives. Due to the potential for synergy with 
                this combination, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster. Spirit of the Horn also provides no benefit with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Suspend effect from Drengr’s Lash will stun Unstoppable Champions. Spirit of the Horn can also stun Unstoppable Champions if it triggers an Ignition.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/abeyant.png"></img>Spirit of the Abeyant</h4>
            <h5>"Improves Drengr's Lash. Drengr's Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/alphalupi.png"></img>Spirit of Alpha Lupi</h4>
            <h5>"Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While an explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Abeyant and Spirit of Alpha Lupi, with both perks granting an effect upon casting a Barricade, Spirit of Alpha 
                Lupi provides a very weak heal effect and is unreliable as defensive utility. Additionally, since Spirit of Abeyant provides a Suspend effect over a large area, 
                the heal effect may be unnecessary since enemies will be unable to attack while Suspended. This means Spirit of Alpha Lupi is often a perk that provides no measurable 
                benefits, and replacing it for a more powerful perk is recommended alongside Spirit of the Abeyant. Due to the weak nature of Spirit of Alpha Lupi, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of a Barricade is recommended with Spirit of the Abeyant, as it provides a much weaker Suspend effect if used with Thruster. Spirit of Alpha Lupi also provides no benefit with Thruster.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Abeyant and Spirit of the Armamentarium. However, both perks provide useful supportive effects, with Abeyant’s 
                wide-range Suspension effect providing powerful defensive utility and Armamentarium’s extra Grenade charge allowing for a more Grenade-focused setup. While it 
                is not the most strictly powerful setup, it will perform consistently across all content in the game. Due to the inherent beneficial effects provided with little 
                drawbacks, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for two uses of the Unbreakable Aspect if Grenade energy is managed correctly.</p>
