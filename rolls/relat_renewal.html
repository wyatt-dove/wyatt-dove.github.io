            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/renewal.png"></img>Spirit of Renewal</h4>
            <h5>"Allies inside the Duskfield grenade field gain Frost Armor and targets inside the field deal reduced damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of Synthoceps, the two perks can be used in combination with each other in practice. 
                A Duskfield Grenade can be used to provide additional defensive utility while the player attempts to close the gap between enemies to gain the Melee boost from 
                Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Renewal provides very potent defensive utility both in the form of Frost Armor and by reducing enemy targets’ damage output, 
                additionally boasting moderate uptime at base with Duskfield Grenade’s low base cooldown. Spirit of Synthoceps provide a powerful Melee damage boost that is worth 
                the risk of being near enemies, especially combined with Spirit of Renewal. Due to the powerful offensive and defensive utility provided by this combination, it is 
                placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Frozen enemies take increased Melee damage, allowing for more direct synergy if the Duskfield Grenade is used to Freeze enemies.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Renewal / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/renewal.png"></img>Renewal + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/renewal.png"></img>Spirit of Renewal</h4>
            <h5>"Allies inside the Duskfield grenade field gain Frost Armor and targets inside the field deal reduced damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Star-Eater, both perks separately provide very potent utility. The Super Ability damage 
                bonus provided by Spirit of the Star-Eater is universally potent, and Spirit of Renewal provides consistent defensive utility with moderate base uptime due to 
                Duskfield Grenade’s low base cooldown. Due to the powerful offensive and defensive utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/renewal.png"></img>Renewal + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct anti-synergy exists between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of Renewal provides defensive benefits to the Duskfield Grenade, which deals 
                minimal damage at base and only serves to Freeze enemies. Spirit of Verity provides a Grenade damage bonus, which sees no benefit with Duskfield Grenades. 
                It is more beneficial to use any other perk in combination with either perk present in this combination. Due to the presence of an anti-synergy in this combination, 
                it is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Hunters have access to the Renewal Grasps Exotic Gauntlets, which can be used instead of this combination to gain the full effects of Spirit of Renewal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Both Grapple Melee and the unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability are boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Renewal / Cyrtarachne[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/renewal.png"></img>Renewal + <img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Cyrtarachne</button>
        <div class="collcontent">

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Spirit of the Cyrtarachne</h4>
            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A very potent defensive synergy exists between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Spirit of Renewal provides Frost Armor from Duskfield Grenades, while 
                Spirit of the Cyrtarachne provides Woven Mail upon casting a Grenade Ability. Both Frost Armor and Woven Mail are powerful sources of damage resistance which can 
                stack on top of each other to provide an even stronger benefit. Due to the inherent high uptime of Duskfield Grenade at base, this combination sees very high uptime 
                of potent damage resistance effects. Due to the powerful defensive utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Activating the unique Grenade Ability provided by the Gunpowder Gamble Aspect will activate Spirit of the Cyrtarachne.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While Duskfield Grenade has a low base cooldown, it is also beneficial to supplement this through external sources to obtain even higher uptime on the effects of both Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/renewal.png"></img>Spirit of Renewal</h4>
            <h5>"Allies inside the Duskfield grenade field gain Frost Armor and targets inside the field deal reduced damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Spirit of the Gyrfalcon</h4>
            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon, both perks provide strong utility separately. Due to the high intrinsic uptime 
                of Invisibility provided by the Stylish Executioner Aspect, Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will boast high uptime on its Volatile Rounds effect. Combined further with 
                Duskfield Grenades and their added defensive utility from Spirit of Renewal, this combination sees potent offensive and defensive utility, only requiring 
                Void-elemental Weapons to take full advantage of it. Due to the offensive and defensive utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use of the Stylish Executioner Aspect is recommended, as it will provide high Invisibility uptime for Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. The Slow effect inflicted by Duskfield Grenades allow for easy activation of Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While Duskfield Grenade has a low base cooldown, it is also beneficial to supplement this through external sources to obtain even higher uptime on the effects of both Spirit of Renewal and Stylish Executioner for Spirit of the Gyrfalcon.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Spirit of the Liar</h4>
            <h5>"Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful Arc melee counterpunch."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is implicit synergy between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Liar. Spirit of the Liar promotes a Melee-focused setup and playstyle, which can provide potent 
                offensive output at the cost of being close to enemies, which can prove to be dangerous in higher tier content. Spirit of Renewal provides the defensive utility to 
                help the player survive the close-quarters engagements and fully harness the power of Spirit of the Liar Due to the combined offensive and defensive utility of this 
                combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liar’s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Frozen enemies take increased Melee damage, allowing for more direct synergy if the Duskfield Grenade is used to Freeze enemies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While Duskfield Grenade has a low base cooldown, it is also beneficial to supplement this through external sources to obtain even higher uptime on the effects of Spirit of Renewal.</p>
                </li>

            <h5>"Dodging gives a small health and shield bump."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no synergy between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Wormhusk. The defensive utility provided by Spirit of Renewal is potent as a standalone perk, 
                but the minor heal effect provided by Spirit of the Wormhusk is unreliable as a source of defensive utility. Nearly any second-column perk would provide a more 
                potent combination as opposed to Spirit of the Wormhusk. Due to the weak nature of Spirit of the Wormhusk and subsequent lack of offensive utility provided by 
                this combination, it is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>While Duskfield Grenade has a low base cooldown, it is also beneficial to supplement this through external sources to obtain even higher uptime on the effects of Spirit of Renewal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The damage resistance provided by Spirit of Renewal indirectly boosts the heal effect of Spirit of Wormhusk by allowing the minor heal to count as more effective health (since it takes reduced damage), but the amount of health restored is so minor that this is unfortunately a negligible boost in practice.</p>
                </li>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Renewal and Spirit of the Coyote. However, both perks provide useful utility benefits in the form of damage resistance 
                from Spirit of Renewal and a bonus Class Ability charge from Spirit of the Coyote. Both effects are universally applicable, but the overall effectiveness of this 
                combination is weaker than other combinations which provide more specific boosts to the player. Due to the general applicability and ease-of-use of this combination, 
                it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>While Duskfield Grenade has a low base cooldown, it is also beneficial to supplement this through external sources to obtain even higher uptime on the effects of Spirit of Renewal.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Coyote indirectly allows for increased Melee Ability uptime via the use of Gambler’s Dodge, which can supplement the apparent lack of offensive utility provided by this combination.</p>
