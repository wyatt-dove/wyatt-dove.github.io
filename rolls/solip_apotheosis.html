            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct synergy can be found with Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of Synthoceps. The extremely high Melee Ability uptime in the brief duration after casting a Super 
                Ability can be enhanced through the Melee damage bonus provided by Spirit of Synthoceps. This can allow for extremely high damage output in a short amount of time 
                following the user’s Super Ability. This combination retains half of its effectiveness outside of the brief duration after a Super Ability, found in Spirit of 
                Synthoceps. The powerful burst damage potential alongside the partially retained effectiveness outside of the Spirit of Apotheosis regeneration window places this 
                combination in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Incinerator Snap and the resulting Ignition it can create both benefit from the Melee damage buff from Spirit of Synthoceps. Combined with Spirit of Apotheosis, this can allow for incredibly quick creation of multiple high-damage Ignitions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Apotheosis / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct and powerful synergy exists between Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of the Star-Eater. Spirit of the star-Eater dramatically boosts the damage output of 
                Super Abilities, while Spirit of Apotheosis allows for sustaining a high damage output for a brief duration after the Super Ability through its Grenade and Melee 
                regeneration. Combining these perks allows for immensely powerful damage output from the player’s Super Ability and the subsequent high ability uptime from Apotheosis. 
                However, this combination provides no benefit to the player outside of this window of time. Since the effect it provides is incredibly powerful, this combination 
                is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Super Ability options for pairing with Spirit of the Star-Eater are Song of Flame for sustained damage and Nova Bomb for quick burst damage. Needlestorm is not recommended since only the initial impact of the needles is buffed by the Star-Eater damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the user has a different Exotic Class Item with Spirit of the Star-Eater and a differing first-column perk (i.e. an Osmiomancy / Star-Eater combination), the user can keep this other combination equipped until they have their super, 
                        momentarily swap to the Spirit of Apotheosis combination to receive the benefits, then swap back to the initial combination. This will retain the Spirit of the Star-Eater damage boost as long as both combinations have the perk.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Apotheosis / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of Verity have a direct synergy. Spirit of Verity provides a powerful damage boost to Grenade Abilities, while Spirit of Apotheosis 
                allows for very high uptime of the Grenade and Melee Abilities following the end of a Super Ability. If Spirit of Verity can be maintained for this window of time 
                following a Super Ability, then consecutive high-damaging Grenade Abilities can be used. However, due to the need for consistent final blows to maintain Spirit of 
                Verity’s Grenade damage boost, this ideal high damage output can be inconsistent to achieve in real time gameplay. Additionally, outside of the small window of time 
                following a Super Ability, Spirit of Apotheosis provides no benefits, meaning the player will only benefit from Spirit of Verity until they have charged another 
                Super Ability. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are strongly recommended for this combination, as they are the highest damage Grenades available for Spirit of Verity to benefit. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy, but can be an effective option for targeting multiple separate enemies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Both the unique Grenade Ability granted by the Song of Flame super and the Freezing Singularity Prismatic Grenade receive the benefits of Spirit of Verity. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Song of Flame or Transcendence is active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Apotheosis / Vesper[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Vesper</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Spirit of Vesper</h4>
            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no synergy between Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of Vesper. The Ability regeneration supplied by Spirit of Apotheosis following a Super Ability does not 
                apply to Class Abilities, so Spirit of Vesper cannot benefit from Spirit of Apotheosis. Spirit of Vesper also has a weak effect on its own, requiring the user to 
                place a Rift Ability near enemies to damage them with the shockwaves. Spirit of Apotheosis has no effect outside of the short window of time following a Super 
                Ability. Combined with Spirit of Vesper’s inherently restrictive and weak effect that has no synergy with Spirit of Apotheosis, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The shockwaves from Spirit of Vesper will Blind enemies if the Stormtrance Super Ability is equipped. However, this is not recommended due to how weak Stormtrance is compared to the other Supers available to Prismatic Warlock.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to have an external source of Class Ability regeneration, such as the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or Class Ability-related Armor Mods, since Spirit of Vesper provides no energy generation effects.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Apotheosis / Harmony[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Harmony</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is a strong, direct synergy between Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of Harmony. Spirit of Harmony provides large Super Ability energy gains from matching 
                elemental Weapon final blows, while Spirit of Apotheosis allows for potent uptime of Grenade and Melee Abilities following a Super Ability. Spirit of Harmony 
                aims to remedy the weakness of the low uptime provided by Spirit of Apotheosis. This effect can be quite powerful in practice, and is regarded as the best combination 
                that uses Spirit of Harmony. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since this combination provides no benefit to Grenade, Melee, or Class Abilities in normal gameplay, it is recommended to use Weapons that provide bonuses to these Abilities (i.e. the Demolitionist perk) instead while also matching elements to fulfill the condition for Spirit of Harmony.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Apotheosis / Starfire[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Starfire</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Spirit of Starfire</h4>
            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no synergy between Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of Starfire. Spirit of Apotheosis grants a large boost to Grenade and Melee Ability regeneration, while 
                Spirit of Starfire requires the user to deal Weapon damage while standing in an Empowering Rift. Spirit of Apotheosis provides no Class Ability regeneration boosts, 
                and provides no benefits at all outside of the brief period following a Super Ability. The Grenade energy returns from Spirit of Starfire are negligible and commonly 
                not worth the player placing themselves in danger in an Empowering Rift. Furthermore, Spirit of Starfire provides no Class Ability regeneration benefits, so both 
                perks will see low uptime for a disproportionately small return. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Obtaining defensive utility through other means, such as Devour or Restoration effects, is important before attempting to utilize Empowering Rifts, as they provide no defensive utility on their own.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to have an external source of Class Ability regeneration, such as the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or Class Ability-related Armor Mods, since Spirit of Starefire provides no energy generation effects.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Apotheosis / Swarm[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/swarm.png"></img>Swarm</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Spirit of Apotheosis</h4>
            <h5>"Temporarily gain greatly increased melee and grenade regeneration after your Super ends."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/swarm.png"></img>Spirit of the Swarm</h4>
            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of the Swarm. However, Spirit of the Swarm provides a passive, supplementary boost to damage 
                through the Threadlings generated from Strand Tangles, which has a very high uptime as long as the player is generating enough Tangles. The high uptime of Spirit 
                of the Swarm alongside the supplementary damage it provides indirectly allows for quicker Super Ability energy generation, since it is tied to damage dealt. While 
                it is not an immensely noticeable effect, it is much more worthwhile compared to other combinations with either of these perks. For these reasons, this combination 
                is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to either use the Arcane Needle Melee Ability or the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Awakening in combination with a Strand-elemental Weapon. These will ensure that the player is making as many Tangles as possible to source Threadlings from.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player has access to the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, then this combination becomes incredibly potent. Spirit of the Swarm allows for high uptime on the Spindle damage boost for Euphony, while Spirit of Apotheosis combined with the use of Threadling Grenades allows the player to quickly boost Spindle to its maximum effectiveness.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Apotheosis / Claw[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/apotheosis.png"></img>Apotheosis + <img class="icon" src="../icons/claw.png"></img>Claw</button>

            <h5>"Gain an additional melee charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of Apotheosis and Spirit of the Claw. Spirit of the Claw grants an additional Melee Ability charge with no additional 
                benefits, relying on the first-column perk to expand upon its use. Spirit of Apotheosis grants very high Grenade and Melee Ability regeneration following the use 
                of a Super Ability, which usually involves the player using as many of these Abilities as they can in quick succession. There will rarely be an opportunity where 
                the additional Melee charge granted by Spirit of the Claw boasts any meaningful impact on real time gameplay for this combination. Spirit of Apotheosis also provides 
                no benefit outside of the brief window following the use of a Super Ability. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability is recommended, as it will have a total of four charges accessible because of Spirit of the Claw. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Storm or Threadling Grenades are recommended for Spirit of Apotheosis. Vortex Grenades cannot overlap with each other on the same enemy. Healing and Coldsnap Grenades offer little to no damage output and are frequently a waste to use with Spirit of Apotheosis.</p>
