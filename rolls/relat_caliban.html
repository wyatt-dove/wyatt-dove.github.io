            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A strong, direct synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of Synthoceps. The Melee damage bonus provided by Spirit of Synthoceps makes activating 
                Spirit of Caliban much more consistent. Not only will the Melee Ability deal massively boosted damage, but the Ignition effect created by Spirit of Caliban can 
                allow higher area coverage of traditionally single-target Melee Abilities, such as Combination Blow. Through the use of Gambler’s Dodge, a Prismatic Hunter will 
                have inherently high Melee Ability uptime to supplement this combination. Due to the high level of offensive power provided by this combination, it is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee is both boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps and will create Ignitions from Spirit of Caliban.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can hit multiple targets, such as the Threaded Spike, are capable of creating multiple Ignitions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Ignitions created by Spirit of Caliban will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no direct synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Star-Eater, both perks are extremely powerful independently. Spirit of Caliban provides 
                strong damage spread across a large area from the Ignition effect it provides on powered Melee final blows, while Spirit of the Star-Eater grants a powerful boost 
                to Super Ability damage. This combination is powerful across all content in the game due to the offensive utility provided by both perks, despite the inherent lack 
                of synergy. Due to the universally applicable nature of this combination’s offensive utility, it is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will create Ignitions from Spirit of Caliban.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can hit multiple targets, such as the Threaded Spike, are capable of creating multiple Ignitions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Ignitions created by Spirit of Caliban will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Caliban requires powered Melee final blows, the “Heavy Handed” Gauntlets Armor Mod will allow powered Melee final blows to additionally create Orbs of Power, creating a direct synergy with Spirit of the Star-Eater in the process.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>

            <h5>"Powered melee final blows trigger an ignition."</h5>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of Verity, since Spirit of Caliban provides an Ignition effect to Melee Abilities and Spirit of 
                Verity provides a damage boost to Grenade Abilities. While both perks can be potent, they do not possess the synergy that other perk combinations have. Spirit 
                of Verity will see low uptime unless Grenade energy generation is supplemented externally, while the sheer offensive output provided by the Ignitions from Spirit 
                of Caliban will take away opportunities to gain Spirit of Verity’s effect in the first place. The perks will often be competing for uptime in practice as opposed 
                to synergizing with each other. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in the C tier solely for Spirit of Caliban’s power.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will both create Ignitions via Spirit of Caliban and will be boosted by Spirit of Verity. This is the only ability that allows for direct synergy between the two perks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade and the Gunpowder Gamble Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can hit multiple targets, such as the Threaded Spike, are capable of creating multiple Ignitions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Ignitions created by Spirit of Caliban will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The most effective Super Ability to pair with Spirit of Caliban is Silence and Squall, which consistently refunds half of the Super’s energy. The least effective Super Ability is Golden Gun, which can only refund up to a quarter of the full Super Energy. All other Super Abilities will see varying refunds depending on the situation.</p>

            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Spirit of the Caliban augments Melee Abilities with an additional Ignition 
                effect, while Spirit of the Cyrtarachne provides Woven Mail on Grenade usage. However, both of these effects are potent independent of each other, with the only 
                restriction being the need for supplemental Grenade energy generation for Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. If properly utilized, this combination will provide potent 
                offensive and defensive power, only losing effectiveness in higher tier content where it will be more difficult to activate Spirit of the Caliban’s effect. Due 
                to the combined offensive and defensive utility provided, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Activating the unique Grenade Ability provided by the Gunpowder Gamble Aspect will activate Spirit of the Cyrtarachne.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Grenade, upon activation, will grant Woven Mail via Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Upon using Grapple Melee, it will also create Ignitions via Spirit of Caliban. This is the only ability that allows for direct synergy between the perks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Melee Abilities that can hit multiple targets, such as the Threaded Spike, are capable of creating multiple Ignitions.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The Ignitions created by Spirit of Caliban will stun Unstoppable Champions.</p>

            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. However, due to Prismatic Hunter’s intrinsic access to Invisibility, Spirit of the 
                Gyrfalcon will see high uptime on Volatile Rounds without additional supplementation needed. This means that the offensive utility provided by Spirit of Caliban’s 
                Ignitions and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon’s Volatile Rounds can both be accessed without either perk clashing with each other. While both perks have better perk pairings 
                available to them, this combination has very generally-applicable offensive utility. Due to the offensive utility provided despite the inherent lack of synergy, this 
                combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct, powerful synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Liar. By nature, Spirit of the Liar encourages a Melee-oriented setup, enhanced by the 
                unique Melee attack it provides. This directly feeds into Spirit of the Caliban, creating an Ignition on every powered Melee final blow. When combined with 
                Combination Blow, this perk combination not only features high single-target Melee damage, but will spread the damage across a wide area through the Ignitions 
                it will create. This allows for one of the most powerful setups in the game for most content. Due to the sheer power of the synergy provided, this combination 
                is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liar’s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will both create Ignitions from Spirit of Caliban and allow immediate use of the unique Melee attack provided by Spirit of the Liar.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Wormhusk. While the offensive utility provided by the Ignitions from Spirit of Caliban is potent, 
                Spirit of the Wormhusk provides a heal effect that is weak and unreliable in the majority of situations. Spirit of the Wormhusk only serves to hold back the 
                potential power output of Spirit of Caliban, making nearly any other perk more desirable in the second column. Due to the lack of synergy and weak nature of 
                Spirit of Wormhusk, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A synergy exists between Spirit of Caliban and Spirit of the Coyote, specifically when used with the Gambler’s Dodge Class Ability. Spirit of the Coyote’s additional 
                Class Ability charge combined with Gambler’s Dodge allows for higher Melee Ability uptime, which in turn allows for more frequent Ignition creations from Spirit of 
                Caliban. This combination is more passive in nature combined with other Spirit of Caliban perk combinations, but it provides similar levels of offensive output in 
                most content in the game, making it a strong combination overall. The synergy present between the two perks alongside the raw power provided by Spirit of Caliban 
                places this combination in the A tier.</p>
