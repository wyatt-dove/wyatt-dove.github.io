            <h5>"Your grenades recharge quicker on hits. The seeker spawned from Coldsnap grenades travels farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While neither Spirit of Osmiomancy nor Spirit of Synthoceps synergize with each other, both provide exceptionally powerful effects. Spirit of Osmiomancy, on average, 
                will refund half of the player’s Grenade energy independent of other sources. This effect on its own nearly doubles the effective uptime of Grenade Abilities. 
                Synthoceps provides a powerful Melee damage bonus. While it does not synergize with Spirit of Osmiomancy, the effect it provides is strong enough to warrant using 
                anyway. Since both perks are powerful on their own and place very few restrictions on the player, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Synthoceps provides a damage boost to the Ignition created by Incinerator Snap as well, providing a large spike of damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Healing Grenade sees lower returns since it requires healing allies, and Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While neither Spirit of Osmiomancy nor Spirit of the Star-Eater directly synergize with each other, both perks are immensely powerful on their own. Spirit of 
                Osmiomancy sees consistently high Grenade energy refunds, and Spirit of the Star-Eater dramatically boosts Super Ability damage output. Both perks provide 
                immensely powerful benefits with effectively no restrictions placed upon the player. Due to the raw power and accessibility of this combination, it is placed 
                firmly in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Super Ability options for pairing with Spirit of the Star-Eater are Song of Flame for sustained damage and Nova Bomb for quick burst damage. Needlestorm is not recommended since only the initial impact of the needles is buffed by the Star-Eater damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to use the “Firepower” Gauntlets Armor Mod, which creates an Orb of Power upon obtaining a final blow with a Grenade Ability. This Mod creates a direct synergy between the two perks, allowing Spirit of Osmiomancy’s high Grenade Ability uptime to feed directly into Spirit of the Star-Eater’s increased Super damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability allows you to store up to three charges by default, which will each count as an activation for Osmiomancy’s ability regeneration boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Healing Grenade sees lower returns since it requires healing allies, and Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Osmiomancy / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/osmiomancy.png"></img>Osmiomancy + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/osmiomancy.png"></img>Spirit of Osmiomancy</h4>
            <h5>"Your grenades recharge quicker on hits. The seeker spawned from Coldsnap grenades travels farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct, powerful synergy exists between Spirit of Osmiomancy and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of Osmiomancy supplements the large Grenade damage bonus provided by 
                Spirit of Verity with its consistently high Grenade energy refunds, as long as the player hits a sufficient number of enemies. This combination allows for very 
                high uptime on very high damaging Grenades as long as the player can maintain the buff provided by Spirit of Verity. The only potential limitation for this 
                combination arises in higher-tier content, where it is more difficult to obtain elemental Weapon final blows due to the high health pools of enemies. This will 
                make maintaining Spirit of Verity’s damage boost more difficult, but not impossible. Due to the inherent high power and strong synergy, this combination is placed 
                in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to use high-damage potential Grenade Abilities with Spirit of Verity. These include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades on Warlock. Coldsnap and Healing Grenades gain little to no benefit, making the majority of the power from this combination irrelevant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Both the unique Grenade Ability granted by the Song of Flame super and the Freezing Singularity Prismatic Grenade receive the benefits of Spirit of Verity. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Song of Flame or Transcendence is active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Osmiomancy / Vesper[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/osmiomancy.png"></img>Osmiomancy + <img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Vesper</button>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/osmiomancy.png"></img>Spirit of Osmiomancy</h4>
            <h5>"Your grenades recharge quicker on hits. The seeker spawned from Coldsnap grenades travels farther."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Spirit of Vesper</h4>
            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No direct synergy exists between Spirit of Osmiomancy and Spirit of Vesper. While Osmiomancy allows for very consistently high energy refunds on Grenade Abilities, 
                Spirit of Vesper does not take advantage of this, instead augmenting the player’s Rift Abilities with damaging shockwaves. Since Osmiomancy centers around the usage 
                of Grenade Abilities, the player will often find themselves at a longer range from enemies, outside of the effective range of Spirit of Vesper. Additionally, Spirit 
                of Vesper locks the player into using a Rift Ability and provides no Class Ability regeneration to supplement this. The damage output from the shockwaves is rarely 
                worth disrupting the player’s positioning to place a rift near enemies, when the player could instead achieve the same result using a Grenade Ability and receiving 
                the high energy refund from Spirit of Osmiomancy. This combination is placed in the C tier solely for the high Grenade uptime from Osmiomancy.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Healing Grenade sees lower returns since it requires healing allies, and Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The shockwaves from Spirit of Vesper will Blind enemies if the Stormtrance Super Ability is equipped. However, this is not recommended due to how weak Stormtrance is compared to the other Supers available to Prismatic Warlock.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to have an external source of Class Ability regeneration, such as the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or Class Ability-related Armor Mods, since Spirit of Vesper provides no energy generation effects.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Osmiomancy / Harmony[1]-->

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While neither Spirit of Osmiomancy nor Spirit of Harmony provide direct synergy with each other, both effects are powerful and desirable on their own with very little 
                restrictions placed on the player. Spirit of Osmiomancy provides high Grenade Ability uptime through its energy refunds on Grenade damage, while Spirit of Harmony 
                allows for increased Super Ability uptime through its energy generation on final blow effect. There is the possibility of these perks conflicting with each other, 
                since Grenade Ability final blows do not contribute anything for Spirit of Harmony, and weapon final blows do not contribute anything for Spirit of Osmiomancy. 
                However, this conflict is negligible and can be used dynamically depending on the player’s needs in a given situation. Due to the independently strong effects offered 
                by the perks in this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Healing Grenade sees lower returns since it requires healing allies, and Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Spirit of Starfire</h4>
            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Both Spirit of Osmiomancy and Spirit of Starfire independently work to enhance the uptime of the Grenade Ability. Combining the effects of the perks allows for even 
                higher uptime on Grenade Abilities, at the cost of needing to use the Empowering Rift Class Ability to access Spirit of Starfire’s benefits. Empowering Rift has very 
                little defensive utility, meaning the player will be placing themselves in danger to access the benefits of Spirit of Starfire. No additional Class Ability energy 
                generation is supplied by Starfire either, meaning the player will need to supplement this to maintain uptime on Starfire’s benefits. However, the incredibly high 
                uptime on Grenade Abilities that this combination allows can be worth the tradeoffs required to fully benefit from them. Due to the inherently powerful offensive 
                synergy at the cost of defensive utility, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Healing Grenade sees lower returns since it requires healing allies, and Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Obtaining defensive utility through other means, such as Devour or Restoration effects, is important before attempting to utilize Empowering Rifts, as they provide no defensive utility on their own.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to have an external source of Class Ability regeneration, such as the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or Class Ability-related Armor Mods, since Spirit of Starefire provides no energy generation effects.</p>

            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no direct synergy exists between Spirit of Osmiomancy and Spirit of the Swarm, both perks are consistently powerful with no restrictions placed on the player. 
                Spirit of Osmiomancy allows for consistently high energy refunds on Grenade Abilities, while Spirit of the Swarm allows for an additional, supplementary damage source 
                from the Threadlings generated by Strand Tangles. This combination creates powerful sources of both active and passive damage output with very high accessibility and 
                ease of use. The sheer ease of use and low risk combined with the high damage output offered by this combination places it in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to either use the Arcane Needle Melee Ability or the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Awakening in combination with a Strand-elemental Weapon. These will ensure that the player is making as many Tangles as possible to source Threadlings from.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A powerful weapon combination is the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, if the player has acquired it. Spirit of the Swarm helps to maintain the Spindle damage buff for Euphony, and the Threadlings that Euphony creates on sustained damage will activate the energy refund mechanic of Spirit of Osmiomancy. It is uncertain if this is intentional behavior or not.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself. Healing Grenade sees lower returns since it requires healing allies, and Vortex Grenade can be inconsistent since it has a limit placed on how quickly it can refund energy.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No direct synergy exists between Spirit of Osmiomancy and Spirit of the Claw. However, both serve to passively enhance the uptime of Grenade and Melee Abilities 
                respectively. Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high refunds of Grenade energy, and Spirit of the Claw allows a wider variety of Melee Abilities to be used 
                due to the additional charge granted. While Spirit of Osmiomancy is powerful on its own, Spirit of the Claw does not serve to synergize with it in any way, nor 
                does Spirit of the Claw gain any benefits. It is a combination with high ease-of-use but comparatively low output compared to other combinations with similar ease 
                of use. For these reasons, this combination is in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability is strongly recommended for this combination, due to its default number of charges being increased from three to four because of Spirit of the Claw.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Osmiomancy sees consistently high energy refunds with the Storm, Coldsnap, and Threadling Grenades in particular, assuming that enough enemies are damaged by the Grenade itself.
