            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Utilizing the high ability uptime granted by Inmost Light combined with the strong melee damage
                buff from Synthoceps yields quite a powerful combination. However, this combination is held
                back by the Warlock’s melee ability selection in the first place, since most of their melee ability 
                options are either ranged attacks that are unlikely to be used while surrounded, or used as 
                supportive or debuff-applying abilities rather than for raw damage. There are many situations in 
                which you will use a non-buffed melee ability due to being out of range, or the melee damage
                buff will be redundant when used on a weak ability. However, in the situations where this 
                combination can be used to its fullest potential, it is very potent. For this reason, it is placed in the B tier.
            </p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Incinerator Snap is highly recommended for this roll, as it not only is the highest damaging Melee Ability for Warlocks,
                        but the resulting Ignition is also buffed by Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Scorch damage from Incinerator Snap will also continuously activate Spirit of Inmost Light while enemies are receiving the burn damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If using the Lightning Surge Aspect, equipping the Arcane Needle Melee Ability is recommended since it will allow you to store up to three 
                        Melee charges, and Lightning Surge is often used in situations where Spirit of Synthoceps is active.</p>

            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>This is one of the most powerful general-use pieces of equipment that Warlocks have access to, despite no explicit synergy existing between the two perks. 
                Inmost Light is powerful for maintaining high ability uptime between your Grenade, Melee, and Class Abilities, while Star-Eater provides a hefty damage bonus 
                to the Super Ability of your choice. No specific setup is required to achieve the full potential of this combination. 
                For this reason, this combination is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The two most recommended Super Abilities to use with Spirit of the Star Eater are Nova Bomb and Song of Flame. 
                        Nova Bomb is an excellent option for instant damage, while Song of Flame is excellent for sustaining damage over a longer period of time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to use “Firepower” or “Heavy Handed” Armor Mods, as these will utilize your high-uptime 
                        Grenade and Melee Abilities respectively to generate more Orbs of Power for Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability allows you to store up to three charges by default, which will each count as an activation for Inmost Light’s ability regeneration boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Incinerator Snap’s Scorch damage over time will continuously activate Spirit of Inmost Light each time it deals damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of the Needlestorm Super Ability is not recommended, as only the initial impact of the needles receive the damage boost of Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Inmost Light / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>This perk combination boasts a powerful synergy in lower to mid-tier content, where defeating enemies with your weapons to maintain Verity’s buff is much more easy to accomplish. 
                Inmost Light will aid in maintaining high uptime on your Grenade Ability, while Verity will supply a hefty damage boost to your Grenade Ability if you can maintain it. 
                The only issue that arises is balancing using your Abilities to maintain the regeneration boost of Inmost Light while also obtaining Weapon kills to maintain the damage boost of Verity. 
                Losing either of these buffs can hurt the performance of this roll, but maintaining both can lead to very high uptime of potent Grenade Abilities. For this reason, it is in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Grenades to use for this roll include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades, as these are the highest damaging options for Warlocks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Healing Grenade gains no benefit, as it does not deal damage. Similarly, Coldsnap Grenade gains very little benefit, as its purpose is to Freeze enemies as opposed to dealing direct damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Both the unique Grenade Ability granted by the Song of Flame super and the Freezing Singularity Prismatic Grenade receive the benefits of Spirit of Verity. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, 
                        Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Song of Flame or Transcendence is active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Inmost Light / Vesper[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Vesper</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Spirit of Vesper</h4>
            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of Inmost Light directly improves the uptime of Class Ability energy, which is required to activate Spirit of Vesper’s effect. 
                However, Spirit of Vesper’s shockwave effect leaves much to be desired, as the damage output of the shockwaves is not worth the risk of placing a Rift near enemy targets. 
                Rifts are oftentimes cast from a position of safety away from enemy targets, and it is often more effective to use Weapons or other Abilities to deal damage. 
                Spirit of Vesper attempts to place an offensive function on a tool that is commonly used for defense.
                Spirit of Vesper also has no effect with Phoenix Dive, which has the shortest cooldown and highest mobility of the Warlock Class Abilities. 
                For these reasons, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of the multi-charge Arcane Needle or the damage-over-time applying Incinerator Snap Melee Abilities are recommended to aid in the uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The shockwaves from Spirit of Vesper will Blind enemies if the Stormtrance Super Ability is equipped. However, this is not recommended due to how weak Stormtrance is compared to the other Supers available to Prismatic Warlock.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Inmost Light / Harmony[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Inmost Light + <img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Harmony</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/inmostlight.png"></img>Spirit of Inmost Light</h4>
            <h5>"Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of Inmost Light will aid in maintaining high uptime of your three Abilities, while Spirit of Harmony will aid in maintaining high uptime on your Super ability. 
                However, the two perks tend to work against each other in practice, since Spirit of Inmost Light requires consistent usage of your Abilities to maintain 
                Empowered Abilities for as long as possible, while Spirit of Harmony requires usage of your Weapons to achieve final blows. When gaining the benefits of one of the perks, 
                it is likely that the other perk is not granting any benefits. Both Spirit of Inmost Light and Spirit of Harmony have potent effects on their own, however, 
                and this combination can be used dynamically depending on the situation the player finds themselves in. If the player needs a Super Ability, they can focus on
                 Weapon usage. At other times, they can focus on looping their Abilities with Spirit of Inmost Light. For this reason, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of the multi-charge Arcane Needle or the damage-over-time applying Incinerator Snap Melee Abilities are recommended to aid in the uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light’s uptime.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Spirit of Starfire</h4>
            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of Inmost Light will aid in the uptime of all three Abilities, while Spirit of Starfire aims to aid in the uptime of the Grenade Ability specifically. 
                However, Spirit of Starfire has restrictions in place that cause the effect to be weak overall. Spirit of Starfire only functions within a Well of Radiance or an 
                Empowering Rift. Prismatic Warlock has no access to Well of Radiance, which only leaves Empowering Rift open for activating the effects of Spirit of Starfire. 
                While Spirit of Inmost Light aids in the uptime of this Ability, the Empowering Rift Ability itself provides no defensive benefits and requires the user to be mostly stationary 
                to receive the offensive benefits, placing the player at high risk of death in the majority of situations. This is often not worth the negligible payoff of Starfire when the player could instead use more
                 Abilities to supplement Inmost Light. For this reason, this combination is in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of the multi-charge Arcane Needle or the damage-over-time applying Incinerator Snap Melee Abilities are recommended to aid in the uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light’s uptime.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Obtaining defensive utility through other means, such as Devour or Restoration effects, is important before attempting to utilize Empowering Rifts, as they provide no defensive utility on their own.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While Spirit of Inmost Light aids in the uptime of all three Abilities, Spirit of the Swarm adds a supplementary Threadling-spawning effect to any of the player’s 
                Strand Tangles that they destroy. These Threadlings operate independently of the player, attacking enemy targets that are nearby upon creation. These Threadlings can 
                activate other passive effects as well, such as healing the user if the Threadlings obtain a final blow while Devour is active. Spirit of the Swarm is a powerful 
                source of supplementary damage that enhances the powerful nature of Spirit of Inmost Light. It is a very consistently strong setup in a variety of situations, 
                provided the user has the ability to create Strand Tangles consistently. Due to these reasons, this combination is in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability is incredibly powerful for this combination, as it has three charges by default that can be used for Inmost Light while also easily inflicting the Strand-elemental debuff Unravel, which is required to make Tangles.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Swarm also dramatically enhances the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, as the Threadlings created from Tangles will increment and refresh the Spindle damage bonus of Euphony.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"Gain an additional melee charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>The additional Melee Ability charge from Spirit of the Claw directly synergizes with the increased ability uptime of Spirit of Inmost Light, allowing for much higher 
                Ability uptime overall. While using this combination, a player may find themselves always having an Ability ready to be used at any moment, allowing for a near endless 
                chain reaction of using Abilities to gain increased recharge rate for the other Abilities. This combination does not boast any pure damage boosts, but it provides a 
                very large supplement to aiding the uptime of Abilities. It will also work in the vast majority of content found in the game. Due to these reasons, this combination is in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability is strongly recommended for this combination, due to its default number of charges being increased from three to four because of Spirit of the Claw. This allows for the user to quickly kickstart their ability rotations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Incinerator Snap is also an incredibly powerful option, as the Scorch damage over time effect will consistently activate and refresh the effect of Inmost Light. Having access to two charges of this ability dramatically increases ability uptime of the player’s Grenade and Class Abilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Penumbral Blast is a less powerful option that may be more useful in difficult content featuring Champions. Having two instant-Freeze Melee Abilities can be useful for defending against Unstoppable Champions, since the Shatter effect will stun them.</p>
