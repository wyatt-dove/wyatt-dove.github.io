            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Synthoceps. While Spirit of Synthoceps provides a strong Melee damage boost, which the Prismatic Hunter 
                is capable of capitalizing on, Spirit of the Ophidian serves no purpose to supplement this. Spirit of the Ophidian is a convenience factor for improving the Handling 
                of all equipped Weapons, which may provide marginal damage output boosts in specific Weapon rotations in the best of cases.  Due to the lack of synergy and many 
                better options existing to pair with Spirit of Synthoceps, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Star-Eater. While Spirit of the Star-Eater offers a powerful boost to Super Ability damage, Hunters 
                also have access to the full version of the perk on the Star-Eater Scales Exotic Boots. If the player places little value on the Handling boost provided by Spirit of 
                the Ophidian, then this combination is strictly less powerful than simply using the Star-Eater Scales Exotic Boots. However, if the player does not have a usable pair 
                of Star-Eater Scales, then they will still see significant power boosts from Spirit of the Star-Eater. Due to the lack of synergy combined with Hunters having access 
                to a stronger version of Spirit of the Star-Eater, this synergy is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Ophidian / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of Verity serves as a powerful Grenade damage boost if the player can maintain 
                the benefit through elemental Weapon final blows. Spirit of Ophidian provides a Handling boost to all Weapons, which may serve to aid in maintaining uptime on Spirit 
                of Verity. However, this will provide a negligible effect in practice, and Spirit of the Ophidian is much weaker than other available perk combinations for Spirit of 
                Verity. Additionally, without external boosts to Grenade energy regeneration, Spirit of Verity will see little uptime in practice anyway since itp provides no 
                regeneration effects on its own.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Both Grapple Melee and the unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability are boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Ophidian / Cyrtarachne[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Cyrtarachne</button>
        <div class="collcontent">

            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Spirit of the Cyrtarachne</h4>
            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. While the Woven Mail effect provided by Spirit of the Cyrtarachne is powerful, very 
                little value is placed on the Handling boost provided by Spirit of the Ophidian. Additionally, without external boosts to Grenade energy regeneration, Spirit of the 
                Cyrtarachne will have low uptime in practice, hindering the defensive utility provided by the perk. Due to the lack of synergy and offensive utility, this combination 
                is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability will grant Woven Mail similarly to a normal Grenade Ability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Gyrfalcon[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Gyrfalcon</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Spirit of the Gyrfalcon</h4>
            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. A Prismatic Hunter’s intrinsic access to Invisibility will allow for high 
                uptime on Spirit of the Gyrfalcon, and the Handling bonus provided by Spirit of the Ophidian seems beneficial for Weapon-oriented setups. However, Spirit of the 
                Ophidian provides very little measurable benefits in practice, meaning most of the offensive utility is sourced from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon, which can struggle 
                to stand on its own as a perk worth using over other stronger combinations. Due to the lack of synergy between the perks, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Liar[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Liar</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Spirit of the Liar</h4>
            <h5>"Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful Arc melee counterpunch."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Liar. For Melee-oriented Prismatic Hunter setups, Spirit of the Liar is a desired perk on its own. 
                However, as a standalone perk, its offensive utility is low, and the Handling bonus provided by Spirit of the Ophidian rarely has measurable impact. It may be more 
                beneficial to use the original Liar’s Handshake Exotic Gauntlets than to use this combination. Due to the lack of synergy between the perks, this combination is 
                placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liar’s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate Spirit of the Liar, allowing the player to follow up with the unique Melee Ability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This roll may be desirable for PvP environments, where the passive effects provided may be more useful than other effects which are more difficult to activate and take advantage of.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h5>"Dodging gives a small health and shield bump."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>NNo synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Wormhusk. The boost to Weapon Handling from Spirit of the Ophidian provides a negligible boost in 
                practice, and the heal effect provided by Spirit of the Wormhusk is too weak to be a reliable source of defensive utility. This combination lacks both powerful 
                defensive utility and any offensive utility at all. Due to the overall weak nature of this combination combined with the lack of synergy between the perks, this 
                combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>This roll may be desirable for PvP environments, where the passive effects provided may be more useful than other effects which are more difficult to activate and take advantage of.</p>

            <h5>"Gain an additional class ability charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Coyote. The Handling boost provided by Spirit of the Ophidian provides a negligible boost in practice. However, the 
                additional Class Ability charge provided by Spirit of the Coyote combined with the low base cooldown of the Dodge Abilities can indirectly be a reliable source of offensive 
                utility, either through the Reload effect from Marksman’s Dodge or the Melee Ability refresh from Gambler’s Dodge. However, Spirit of the Ophidian does not capitalize on these 
                features, which hinders this combination’s effectiveness compared to other options. Due to the lack of synergy between the perks, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If using the Gambler’s Dodge Class Ability, Spirit of the Coyote indirectly allows for substantially increased Melee Ability uptime as well, since Gambler’s Dodge instantly refunds a Melee Ability on cast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The additional Class Ability charge provided by Spirit of the Coyote can also allow for high uptime on the Ascension and Threaded Specter Aspects.</p>
                </li>
