            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/necrotic.png"></img>Spirit of the Necrotic</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging targets with your melee poisons them. Defeating a poisoned target spreads the condition."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Synthoceps provides a powerful Melee damage boost, while Spirit of the Necrotic 
                provides a supplementary damage over time effect with its poison application on Melee. This leads to incredibly high damage output from Melee attacks if the player 
                can reliably activate the damage boost from Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Synthoceps only reliably functions with a small selection of the Melee Abilities available 
                to Warlock, however, since most do not inflict high damage to begin with. It is quite potent with the few Melee abilities it does work with, placing this combination firmly 
                in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Synthoceps provides a damage boost to the Ignition created by Incinerator Snap as well, providing a large spike of damage. The poison damage from Spirit of the Necrotic will help defeat targets that survive the Ignition.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Lightning Surge Aspect is enhanced by both perks available here, receiving the damage boost from Synthoceps and the poison application from Necrotic. The poison is capable of activating the Jolt effect applied by Lightning Surge, dealing large damage over a group of enemy targets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of the Star-Eater, Spirit of the Star-Eater is an incredibly potent and desirable effect since 
                Warlocks do not typically have access to it. The damage bonus it applies to Super Abilities is straightforward to achieve and incredibly potent at its maximum power. 
                Spirit of the Necrotic offers a minor boost to Melee Abilities, increasing their damage potential by inflicting a poison effect that can propagate itself across groups of 
                enemy targets. Both effects are powerful on their own, placing this combination firmly in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Super Ability options for pairing with Spirit of the Star-Eater are Song of Flame for sustained damage and Nova Bomb for quick burst damage. Needlestorm is not recommended since only the initial impact of the needles is buffed by the Star-Eater damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Necrotic enhances the Melee Ability while Spirit of Verity enhances the 
                Grenade Ability. While both effects are rather useful on their own, the lack of synergy leads to a low overall power for this combination. Both perks have stronger 
                combinations that can fully utilize their effects, while they only function separately in this combination Due to a lack of synergy between the perks holding them 
                both back from achieving their potential, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to use high-damage potential Grenade Abilities with Spirit of Verity. These include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades on Warlock. Coldsnap and Healing Grenades gain little to no benefit, making the majority of the power from this combination irrelevant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>

            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of Vesper. Spirit of the Necrotic enhances the Melee Ability while Spirit of Vesper enhances the 
                Rift Class Abilities. The shockwave effects generated by Vesper are rather weak when they are not combined with another Rift-enhancing perk in the first column. 
                Spirit of Vesper also requires the use of a Rift, locking the player out from using Phoenix Dive. Alongside the lack of Class Ability regeneration effects, Spirit of 
                Vesper will be a perk with high downtime and little impact with the uptime it does have. While Spirit of the Necrotic is desirable on its own, it is not potent enough to 
                warrant having a weak perk with no synergy in the second column. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing Rift Ability energy generation is necessary to maintain uptime on Spirit of Vesper, since it provides no Ability generation effects by default.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"Damaging targets with your melee poisons them. Defeating a poisoned target spreads the condition."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of Harmony, both effects are rather powerful and useful independently. Spirit of Harmony 
                allows for potentially very high uptime on Super Abilities with its energy regeneration on final blow effect. Spirit of the Necrotic can be used to supplement this 
                effect, applying the poison damage alongside other effects provided by the Warlock’s Melee abilities to enemies to allow for easier acquisition of final blows for 
                Spirit of Harmony. While this combination does not have any explicit synergy, neither perk imposes a very strong restriction on the player, with Spirit of Harmony’s 
                matching Weapon and Super element restriction being very straightforward to fulfill. Due to these reasons, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>
                </li>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Spirit of Starfire</h4>
            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of Starfire. Spirit of the Necrotic provides a beneficial effect to Melee Abilities on its own 
                with few downsides. However, Spirit of Starfire locks the player into using the Empowering Rift for the purpose of generating Grenade energy. Empowering Rift provides 
                no defensive utility, requiring the player to place themselves in danger for comparably little returns on Grenade energy. Spirit of Starfire requires a Rift-boosting 
                effect in the first column to be a competitive choice. The poison damage provided by Spirit of the Necrotic has no interaction with Spirit of Starfire, since Starfire 
                requires Weapon damage. The restrictions imposed by Spirit of Starfire combined with the lack of synergy between the perks places this combination in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Feed the Void Aspect will not only provide a powerful healing effect through Devour, but will also provide additional supplementary Grenade Ability generation. This provides the extra health sustain needed to fully take advantage of Spirit of Starfire.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of Starfire does not inherit the Rift regeneration effect from its parent Exotic. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>

            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of the Swarm, both perks serve a unique function that are powerful enough on their own. 
                Spirit of the Necrotic allows for consistent damage output from Melee Abilities, while Spirit of the Swarm adds an additional source of supplementary damage output 
                from the Threadlings created from Strand Tangles. These perks may sometimes align in such a way that the player is constantly outputting damage from some source 
                independent of their own actions, which can add up to quite a large amount of damage over time. Since both perks provide desirable boosts with little to no 
                restrictions placed on the player, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The usage of the Arcane Needle Melee Ability is strongly recommended with this combination. The Unravel debuff applied to enemies will self-propagate itself due to the poison damage supplied by Spirit of the Necrotic, leading to consistent generation of Strand Tangles required by Spirit of the Swarm alongside an additional source of damage over time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player has acquired the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, Spirit of the Swarm is a very popular choice to help maintain uptime on the Spindle damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h5>"Gain an additional melee charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: S</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Direct synergy exists between Spirit of the Necrotic and Spirit of the Claw. With Spirit of the Claw providing an additional Melee Ability charge, the uptime of Spirit 
                of the Necrotic’s poison damage over time is dramatically boosted. Spirit of the Claw also allows easier use of a wider variety of Melee Abilities solely because it 
                provides a second charge. Since both perks synergize very strongly with the player’s selected Melee Ability and allow for consistently high damage output through 
                damage over time effects, this combination is placed in the S tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability will gain a total of four charges when used with Spirit of the Claw. Additionally, the poison damage will aid in propagating the Unravel debuff to more enemies over a wider area.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Lightning Surge Aspect will apply both its Jolt effect and the poison damage effect from Spirit of the Necrotic, which aids in triggering the Jolt damage effect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Weapons that apply a similar poison effect, such as Thorn or Osteo Striga, will cause bursts of poison spread on final blows, synergizing with Spirit of the Necrotic.</p>
