            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of the Synthoceps. While Synthoceps provides a powerful damage boost to Melee Abilities, 
                Filaments does not provide anything to complement this. Furthermore, Filaments requires an Empowering Rift to be used and provides no benefit if used with Healing 
                Rift or Phoenix Dive. It also provides no Rift energy regeneration effects. Both perks require supplements to their respective Ability’s energy regeneration, but 
                neither perk complements each other. Filaments expends a Class Ability energy to grant Devour, an effect that Warlock already has consistent access to. Due to the 
                lack of synergy and overall restrictions placed by Filaments for a lack of benefits, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Incinerator Snap Melee Ability is recommended, since it is commonly used at a range where Spirit of Synthoceps would be active. Additionally, the Ignition it creates also inherits the damage boost from Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Filaments does not provide any energy regeneration effects on its own. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player is not using the Feed the Void Aspect, the Devour provided by Spirit of the Filaments will be the weaker variant, providing less Health and Grenade energy on subsequent final blows. However, Devour has nearly permanent uptime if Feed the Void is equipped, making Filaments almost irrelevant.</p>

            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater is an incredibly potent effect that a 
                Warlock does not typically have access to. Most combinations are worth using solely for this perk, as the Super damage boost is very powerful, and the maximum 
                effectiveness is straightforward to achieve. However, Filaments does impose the restriction of using an Empowering Rift to receive its benefits. If using the Healing 
                Rift or Phoenix Dive Abilities, Spirit of the Filaments provides no benefit. Furthermore, it provides no method of passive Class Ability regeneration. In most 
                situations, Spirit of the Filaments will be a functionally nonexistent perk, leaving only the boost Spirit of the Star-Eater provides. For these reasons, this 
                combination is in the C tier solely due to the power of Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Super Ability options for pairing with Spirit of the Star-Eater are Song of Flame for sustained damage and Nova Bomb for quick burst damage. Needlestorm is not recommended since only the initial impact of the needles is buffed by the Star-Eater damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Filaments does not provide any energy regeneration effects on its own. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player is not using the Feed the Void Aspect, the Devour provided by Spirit of the Filaments will be the weaker variant, providing less Health and Grenade energy on subsequent final blows. However, Devour has nearly permanent uptime if Feed the Void is equipped, making Filaments almost irrelevant.</p>

            <h5>"Casting an Empowering Rift will grant you Devour."</h5>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A minor synergy exists between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Filaments provides Devour upon casting an Empowering Rift, which can be used 
                to supplement the Grenade Ability regeneration that Spirit of Verity lacks. This allows for higher uptime on the boosted Grenades by Spirit of Verity. However, Spirit 
                of the Filaments locks the user into using Empowering Rift for its effects, which notably provides no defensive utility aside from the Devour effect. Furthermore, 
                Warlocks have a consistently straightforward way to activate Devour via the Feed the Void Aspect, which has the added benefit of improving the effects of Devour. 
                While this combination exhibits synergy, it is not the most optimal synergy and is easily outclassed by a basic Warlock Aspect due to the restrictions placed by 
                Spirit of the Filaments. For these reasons, this combination is in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to use high-damage potential Grenade Abilities with Spirit of Verity. These include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades on Warlock. Coldsnap and Healing Grenades gain little to no benefit, making the majority of the power from this combination irrelevant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Filaments does not provide any energy regeneration effects on its own. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of the Feed the Void Aspect is recommended, since it not only provides additional sources of Devour through the player’s other abilities, but it also improves the Grenade energy returns from subsequent final blows. This provides a greater boost to the uptime of Grenades boosted by Spirit of Verity, increasing damage output overall.</p>
                </li>

            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A minor synergy exists between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of Vesper. Spirit of the Filaments provides a minor defensive utility in the form of Devour upon placing 
                an Empowering Rift, while Spirit of Vesper will release shockwaves from this Rift that will damage and stagger enemies. If Spirit of Vesper’s shockwaves obtain final blows, 
                then it will refresh the Devour effect provided by Spirit of the Filaments. Notably, however, neither perk offers passive Class Ability regeneration despite both requiring a 
                Class Ability to function. Furthermore, Spirit of the Filaments locks the player into using an Empowering Rift, and neither perk has an effect with Phoenix Dive. The overall 
                output of this synergy also diminishes rapidly as content becomes more difficult. For these reasons, this combination is in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to have an external source of Class Ability regeneration, such as the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or Class Ability-related Armor Mods.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Filaments does not provide any energy regeneration effects on its own. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>

            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A very minor implicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of Harmony. Since Spirit of the Filaments requires the use of an Empowering Rift, the 
                player can utilize the boost to weapon damage to more easily achieve final blows and therefore activate the Super energy regeneration effect of Spirit of Harmony. 
                Due to Spirit of Harmony having a rather potent and desirable effect on its own, this combination further improves its effectiveness. However, the restrictions placed 
                by Spirit of the Filaments prevents this combination from reaching the high power levels it has potential for. Spirit of Filaments provides the Devour effect, which is 
                already readily accessible for Warlocks. It also provides no Class Ability regeneration effects, meaning the player will have to supplement it through external means to 
                maintain Empowering Rift uptime. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Filaments does not provide any energy regeneration effects on its own. This can be achieved through either the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or through various Armor Mods that provide Class Ability energy from various sources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player is not using the Feed the Void Aspect, the Devour provided by Spirit of the Filaments will be the weaker variant, providing less Health and Grenade energy on subsequent final blows. However, Devour has nearly permanent uptime if Feed the Void is equipped, making Filaments almost irrelevant.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is an explicit synergy between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of Starfire. Both perks require the use of an Empowering Rift. Spirit of the Filaments provides 
                Devour, which can be used as a source of healing to accommodate for the lack of defensive utility provided by the Empowering Rift. Spirit of Starfire will utilize 
                the empowered Weapon damage provided by the Empowering Rift to further grant Grenade energy. Spirit of Starfire combined with the effect of Devour can allow for very 
                high Grenade ability uptime. Since Warlocks have access to a variety of powerful Grenades, this combination is quite powerful in many aspects of the game. The lack of 
                Class Ability regeneration sources provided by either of the perks holds this combination back, since there will be high downtime between Empowering Rift placements 
                if the ability regeneration is not supplemented through an external source. However, if properly accommodated for, this combination can be quite powerful, and for 
                these reasons, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Usage of the Feed the Void Aspect is strongly recommended, since it not only provides additional sources of Devour through the player’s other abilities, but it also improves the Grenade energy returns from subsequent final blows. This allows for even higher uptime on Grenade Abilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to have an external source of Class Ability regeneration, since neither Spirit of the Filaments nor Spirit of Starfire provide energy generation effects. These effects include the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope or Class Ability-related Armor Mods.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of the Swarm. Both effects attempt to provide a supplementary boost to take advantage of, 
                yet neither of them take advantage of each other. Additionally, Spirit of the Filaments locks the player into using the Empowering Rift, providing no benefit for 
                using Healing Rift or Phoenix Dive. It also provides no passive Class Ability regeneration effects, meaning it has incredibly low uptime unless supplemented by an 
                external source. Spirit of the Swarm is a useful source of supplementary damage, but unless properly taken advantage of through the first column perk, it is a 
                negligible boost. Both perks in this combination have far better partners to be paired with, and alongside the lack of synergy between them, this combination is 
                placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to either use the Arcane Needle Melee Ability or the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Awakening in combination with a Strand-elemental Weapon. These will ensure that the player is making as many Tangles as possible to source Threadlings from.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player has acquired the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, Spirit of the Swarm is a very popular choice to help maintain uptime on the Spindle damage boost. The Devour effect granted by Spirit of the Filaments can also aid in Threadling Grenade uptime.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supplementing your Class Ability energy regeneration is necessary, since Spirit of the Filaments does not provide any energy regeneration effects on its own.

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Filaments and Spirit of the Claw. Both perks provide a supplementary boost to the player’s setup in the form of Devour 
                from Spirit of the Filaments and an additional Melee ability charge from Spirit of the Claw. However, Warlocks have incredibly straightforward access to Devour through 
                the Feed the Void Aspect, which does not require the usage of an Empowering Rift. The Melee charge provided by Spirit of the Claw has potential to be useful, but commonly 
                requires a strong pairing with the first-column perk to take full advantage of. With no synergy existing between the perks alongside the restrictions placed by Spirit of 
                the Filaments for a negligible return, this combination is placed in the D tier solely for the extra Melee charge provided by Spirit of the Claw being universally useful.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
