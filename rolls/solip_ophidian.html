        <!--Ophidian / Synthoceps[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Synthoceps </button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Synthoceps. Ophidian is solely used for the Handling boost it gives to all of your 
                equipped weapons, being more of a convenience factor than a source of raw power. However, Spirit of Synthoceps provides a powerful boost to Melee damage, which 
                can be exploited using a few of the Warlock’s Abilities. Ophidian does provide significant boosts to Weapon swapping speeds, which can be useful for activating 
                certain Weapon perks such as Bait and Switch. However, outside of these situations, Ophidian is only used for its convenience factor, which is difficult to rank. 
                Since there is no direct synergy, and Ophidians share a perk column that can roll with much more measurably powerful perks, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Incinerator Snap melee is recommended for this combo, since the resulting Ignition will also receive the Melee damage boost provided by Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater is a perk that is not accessible to 
                Warlocks outside of the Exotic Class Item, and it is a very potent Super Ability-boosting effect. Additionally, Spirit of the Ophidian provides a boost to the 
                Handling of all equipped Weapons, which is useful for activating certain Weapon-specific perks such as Bait and Switch. There is implicit synergy between these 
                for facing certain Boss enemies, where you use your boosted Super Ability followed by a much quicker Weapon rotation. However, this synergy is not applicable in 
                the vast majority of the game, where Ophidian becomes mostly a convenience factor. Therefore, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The best Super Ability options for pairing with Spirit of the Star-Eater are Song of Flame for sustained damage and Nova Bomb for quick burst damage. Needlestorm is not recommended since only the initial impact of the needles is buffed by the Star-Eater damage boost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It may be worth keeping one copy of this roll to swap to in the few situations where the Handling boost from Ophidian will be useful, such as Raid Boss encounters.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!--Ophidian / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Verity. Due to the nature of Spirit of the Ophidian, the Handling boost it applies to your 
                Weapons is merely a convenience factor in the vast majority of content, offering no measurable boost to power. The bonus Handling may help with Weapon swapping to 
                maintain the Grenade damage buff from Spirit of Verity, however this greatly depends on the player’s setup and does not always provide a meaningful boost. Most of 
                this combination’s raw power is sourced from Spirit of Verity, which boosts Grenade damage by double at maximum power. However, it provides no Grenade Ability 
                regeneration, meaning you will need to draw from other sources to supplement this. For these reasons, this roll is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is strongly recommended to use high-damage potential Grenade Abilities with Spirit of Verity. These include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades on Warlock. Coldsnap and Healing Grenades gain little to no benefit, making the majority of the power from this combination irrelevant.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Vesper[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Vesper</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Spirit of Vesper</h4>
            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Both Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Vesper provide very measurably weak benefits compared to other options in both perk slots. The Handling boost provided by 
                Ophidian is a convenience factor in the majority of content, and the shockwaves provided by Vesper do not deal enough damage to warrant the risk of placing a Rift 
                near enemies. Vesper also locks you into the very immobile Rift Class Abilities, since it does not have any function with the highly mobile Phoenix Dive Class Ability. 
                Since both perk offerings on this combination are weak and provide no synergy with each other, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Healing Rift is recommended, since the healing it provides will provide extra defensive utility to the player when placed near a group of enemies.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Harmony[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Harmony</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of Harmony. However, Spirit of Harmony retains the most powerful part of the perk from its 
                original Exotic Armor, which is the Super Ability regeneration on matching element Weapon final blows. This is a very powerful effect on its own and is desirable 
                on its own. Ophidian serves as a convenience factor, with its Handling boost helping with weapon swaps as needed. This combination is not incredibly powerful, but 
                the convenience factor of Ophidian combined with the high Super Ability uptime from Harmony places this combination in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires a Weapon that matches the element of the player’s Super Ability, this allows the player to easily take advantage of the “Harmonic” series of Armor Mods, which also provide benefits for matching Weapon elements with the Super element.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Starfire[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Starfire</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian."</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Spirit of Starfire</h4>
            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>The Handling bonus provided by Spirit of the Ophidian aims to supplement the process of dealing Empowered Weapon damage to activate the Grenade regeneration of 
                Spirit of Starfire. However, Spirit of Starfire is a very weak source of Grenade energy overall, and Spirit of the Ophidian is only serving as a convenience factor 
                for weapon swapping. Spirit of Starfire also requires the player to use Empowering Rift, sacrificing any defensive utility of the other two Class Abilities for the 
                negligible Grenade energy generation. The raw power from this combination is sourced solely from Spirit of Starfire, which has far too many restrictions to be 
                reliable to use in the vast majority of content. For this reason, it is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Starfire offers no additional Class Ability regeneration, it is recommended to supplement this from various other sources, such as the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope. Otherwise, there will be significant downtime between Empowering Rift placements, and Spirit of Starfire has no other benefits when outside of an Empowering Rift.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Swarm[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/swarm.png"></img>Swarm</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/swarm.png"></img>Spirit of the Swarm</h4>
            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Swarm. Ophidian provides a flat Handling boost to all weapons, serving as a convenience 
                factor in the majority of content. Spirit of the Swarm offers a source of supplementary damage in the form of Threadlings from Strand Tangles, but as the primary 
                power source in this combination, it falls behind other possible combinations. Spirit of the Swarm is a desirable perk, but only when it can be used to supplement 
                the first column perk in some way. Since most of the raw power from this combination comes from Spirit of the Swarm with no other synergy, this combination is 
                placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to either use the Arcane Needle Melee Ability or the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Awakening in combination with a Strand-elemental Weapon. These will ensure that the player is making as many Tangles as possible to source Threadlings from.</p>
                </li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Ophidian / Claw[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Ophidian + <img class="icon" src="../icons/claw.png"></img>Claw</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/ophidian.png"></img>Spirit of the Ophidian</h4>
            <h5>"Weapons ready very quickly."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/claw.png"></img>Spirit of the Claw</h4>
            <h5>"Gain an additional melee charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is no explicit synergy between Spirit of the Ophidian and Spirit of the Claw. Both perks are intended to be supplementary boosts to a setup, with Ophidian 
                providing a universal Handling boost to all Weapons while Claw provides an additional Melee Charge for the player’s chosen Melee Ability. The perks provide no other 
                effect, so any offensive or defensive utility must be found in other sources. It may even be beneficial to use the regular Claws of Ahamkara Exotic Gauntlets, as 
                opposed to this combination. Since both perks on this combination have no synergy and are rather weak on their own, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability will gain a total of four charges when used with Spirit of the Claw.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This combination may be worth keeping solely for using in a PvP environment, since the passive effects may be more impactful than other effects which are more difficult to activate and maintain.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
