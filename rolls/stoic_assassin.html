            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Synthoceps. The Melee damage bonus provided by Spirit of Synthoceps allows for easier access to 
                the Invisibility effect provided by Spirit of the Assassin. This provides a synergy that is more defensive in nature, as opposed to other combinations which focus on 
                solely offensive power. Given that Prismatic Titan possesses Melee Abilities which are powerful at base, Spirit of the Assassin can provide the defensive utility 
                needed to stay alive in more difficult content. Due to the combined offensive and defensive utility provided, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is a powerful choice, as it is both boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps and will activate Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater is an immensely powerful Super 
                Ability-boosting effect that Titans do not traditionally have access to, so it is a worthy choice to use on its own. The defensive utility provided by 
                Spirit of the Assassin for the already Melee-focused Prismatic Titan can also be useful, as Prismatic Titan notoriously lacks strong defensive utility. 
                However, without other Melee-damage boosts, it may be difficult to properly take advantage of Spirit of the Assassin. Additionally, Invisibility is not a 
                very desired effect in lower to mid-tier content. Due to the lack of synergy present in this combination, it is placed in the C tier solely for the power 
                provided by Spirit of the Star-Eater.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As Spirit of the Assassin promotes a Melee-based setup, usage of the Heavy Handed Armor Mod is recommended to create a minor synergy between the two perks present in this combination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!--Assassin / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Assassin provides defensive utility in the form of Invisibility through powered 
                Melee kills, while Spirit of Verity boosts Grenade Ability damage. In addition to the lack of synergy, both perks will see low uptime without methods to supplement 
                the Ability energy generation, and both perks lose effectiveness as enemies become harder to defeat in high-level content. Due to the lack of synergy and overall 
                weak effects granted by this combination, it is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity. Unbreakable does not, however, activate Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Contact[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Contact</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/contact.png"></img>Spirit of Contact</h4>
            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Contact, as both provide bonuses to Melee Abilities. However, it may be difficult to fully utilize 
                both perks simultaneously. Obtaining powered Melee final blows provides Invisibility, which is broken by any offensive action, which is required to take advantage of 
                the Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact. However, Spirit of Contact provides a powerful offensive boost on its own, so Spirit of Assassin can be used as a 
                safety defensive feature. Due to the combined offensive and defensive utility provided by this combination, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The lightning strikes provided by Spirit of Contact will <i>not</i> trigger Spirit of the Assassin if they obtain final blows.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Assassin / Scars[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Scars</button>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Scars. Both perks aim to provide defensive utility, which Prismatic Titan is generally in need 
                of. However, Spirit of the Scars provides an incredibly potent Restoration effect that can also apply to the player’s Allies, while also maintaining extremely high 
                uptime. This can often overshadow Spirit of the Assassin, as the Invisibility effect provided may be less desirable than a direct healing effect. Spirit of the 
                Assassin would be better replaced by an option that provides offensive utility in some form. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in the C tier 
                solely for Spirit of Scars’ potent survivability boosts.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Horn, and both perks provide weak benefits on their own. The Invisibility provided by Spirit of the 
                Assassin may not be desirable as the sole defensive utility option, and Spirit of the Horn’s Solar blast effect both locks the player into using a Barricade Ability 
                and sees low uptime due to the high base cooldown of Barricade Abilities. Spirit of the Horn provides no benefit with the Thruster Class Ability. Due to the lack of 
                synergy and overall weak nature of both perks, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Alpha Lupi. Both perks aim to provide defensive utility, yet the overall utility provided is weak 
                compared to other options available. The Invisibility provided by Spirit of the Assassin may not be desirable as a sole defensive utility option, and the heal 
                effect provided by Spirit of Alpha Lupi is unreliable as a source of defensive utility in the majority of situations. Spirit of Alpha Lupi additionally provides 
                no benefit when used with the Thruster Class Ability, further limiting its effectiveness. Due to the lack of synergy and inherent weak nature of both perks, this 
                combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Alpha Lupi requires either Towering or Rally Barricade. It provides no effect with Thruster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player can reliably obtain Melee Ability final blows, then Spirit of the Assassin may be a strong choice of defensive utility. This becomes harder to achieve as content becomes more difficult, however.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Armamentarium. Both perks augment different abilities, with Spirit of the Assassin granting 
                Invisibility for powered Melee final blows while Spirit of the Armamentarium grants an additional Grenade charge. These perks are designed to act as a supplement 
                to another perk which can take advantage of their effects, but they provide no synergy with each other, limiting its overall effectiveness. Due to the lack of 
                synergy and presence of more effective options for both perks, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Armamentarium can allow for two uses of the Unbreakable Aspect if Grenade energy is managed correctly.</p>
