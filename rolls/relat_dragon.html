            <h5>"Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of the Dragon grants boosts to handling speeds after performing a Dodge, 
                and Spirit of Synthoceps grants increased Melee damage while surrounded. While the Melee damage bonus provided by Spirit of Synthoceps is potent, Spirit of the 
                Dragon offers no benefits to draw from this power. In most content, Spirit of the Dragon only serves as a convenience factor for reloading all Weapons upon 
                performing a Dodge. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant. It will also provide higher Melee Ability uptime for use with Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps.</p>

            <h5>"Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of the Star-Eater, the two perks can separately contribute to increasing the player’s damage 
                output in a Boss damage-focused situation. Spirit of the Star-Eater allows for a potent super, while Spirit of the Dragon will boost Weapon handling after a Dodge 
                while also reloading all Weapons, allowing for less downtime to be spent reloading. This also allows perks that require Weapon swapping to be activated more easily, 
                such as Bait and Switch. While this synergy is not applicable in all content, Spirit of the Star-Eater is a universally powerful perk, and Spirit of the Dragon 
                provides a convenience factor in most content. For these reasons, this combination is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant. Acrobat's Dodge may be used for its Radiant effect, if Radiant cannot be activated through other means.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The only Super Ability that sees little to no benefit with Spirit of the Star-Eater is Shadowshot: Deadfall. All other Super Ability options see significant damage enhancements, most notably Golden Gun.</p>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of Verity. Spirit of the Dragon provides Weapon Handling boosts upon Dodging as well as a full 
                reload, while Spirit of Verity grants boosted Grenade damage from matching elemental Weapon final blows. While the Weapon boosts provided by Spirit of the Dragon 
                aid in maintaining Spirit of Verity uptime, Spirit of Verity lacks innate Grenade energy regeneration boosts. This will lead to high downtime of boosted Grenades 
                unless supplemented by an external source. Due to the need to accommodate for a weakness in this combination alongside the generally negligible boost gained from 
                Spirit of the Dragon, it is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Both Grapple Melee and the unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability are boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Hailfire Spike Prismatic Grenade is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence or Gunpowder Gamble are active with their unique Grenade elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/cyrtarachne.png"></img>Spirit of the Cyrtarachne</h4>
            <h5>"Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of the Cyrtarachne. Spirit of the Dragon provides Weapon Handling boosts upon Dodging as well as a 
                full reload, while Spirit of the Cyrtarachne grants Woven Mail upon Grenade use. While Woven Mail is a strong effect, Spirit of the Cyrtarachne requires an external 
                source of Grenade energy generation to maintain high uptime on the effect. The Weapon Handling boosts provided by Spirit of the Dragon provide no direct synergy for 
                this, and is a generally weak effect in most content. Due to the lack of overall synergy and need for external sources to make up for a weakness, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The unique Gunpowder Gamble Grenade Ability will activate Spirit of the Cyrtarachne.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant.</p>

        <!--Dragon / Gyrfalcon[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/dragon.png"></img>Dragon + <img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Gyrfalcon</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/dragon.png"></img>Spirit of the Dragon</h4>
            <h5>"Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/gyrfalcon.png"></img>Spirit of the Gyrfalcon</h4>
            <h5>"Your Void weapons gain volatile rounds after you emerge from being invisible."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An indirect synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of the Gyrfalcon. Since Prismatic Hunter has consistent access to Invisibility effects through the 
                Stylish Executioner Aspect, Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will have very high uptime on its Volatile Rounds effect. Spirit of the Dragon serves to minimize Weapon downtime 
                by offering an instant reload and boosts to Handling speeds of all Weapons, allowing the player to utilize the Volatile Rounds effect more efficiently. This synergy 
                is only applicable to Void-elemental Weapons, however, and it offers no other benefits aside from the high Volatile Rounds uptime. For this reason, it is placed in 
                the C tier due to the strength of Volatile Rounds.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Volatile Rounds effect granted to Void Weapons from Spirit of the Gyrfalcon will pierce Barrier Champion shields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Dragon / Liar[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/dragon.png"></img>Dragon + <img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Liar</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/dragon.png"></img>Spirit of the Dragon</h4>
            <h5>"Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/liar.png"></img>Spirit of the Liar</h4>
            <h5>"Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful Arc melee counterpunch."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A minor implicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of the Liar. When using Spirit of the Liar, a Melee-focused setup is commonly utilized, 
                including the use of Gambler’s Dodge to maintain high Melee Ability uptime. Spirit of the Dragon simply adds more benefits to the Gambler’s Dodge, including an 
                instant reload effect and boosts to Weapon Handling. However, in a Melee-focused setup, Weapon performance is often secondary to Melee performance, and the first 
                column perk slot is better suited for a perk that would enhance Melee Abilities or offer some other applicable form of utility. Due to the lack of meaningful synergy 
                between the two perks, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Stylish Executioner provides a Melee damage bonus to a Melee attack if the Melee attack is used to break Invisibility. If a Melee Ability is used to enter Invisibility, it will activate Spirit of the Liar’s unique Melee attack, which will additionally get boosted by Stylish Executioner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grapple Melee will activate Spirit of the Liar, allowing the player to follow up with the unique Melee Ability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is highly recommended, as it is used to maintain high Melee Ability uptime to supplement Spirit of the Liar, as well as gaining the benefits of Spirit of the Dragon.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>"Dodging gives a small health and shield bump."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While there is direct synergy between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of the Wormhusk, the overall benefit gained from both perks working in unison is very low. 
                The heal effect offered by Spirit of the Wormhusk is insufficient to serve as a reliable form of defensive utility, and the Weapon boosts provided by Spirit of the 
                Dragon are only strong when used as a supplement for a stronger ability that can take advantage of it. Due to the lack of overall utility offered by this synergy, 
                this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In a PvP environment, this combination may become more desirable, as passive boosts to the player are valued more highly than other effects, which may be difficult to activate and take advantage of in PvP modes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant.</p>

            <h5>"Gain an additional class ability charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Dragon and Spirit of the Coyote. Spirit of the Dragon offers an instant reload effect to all equipped weapons as well as 
                a temporary Handling boost after performing a Dodge. Spirit of the Coyote supplements this effect by allowing the user to hold an additional Class Ability charge, 
                which not only boosts the uptime of Spirit of the Dragon, but it also allows for increased Melee Ability uptime when used in combination with Gambler’s Dodge. While 
                this combination is not as directly potent as many others, it provides universally applicable utility with few downsides, especially if the player is using a 
                Weapon-oriented setup. For this reason, it is placed in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In a PvP environment, this combination may become more desirable, as passive boosts to the player are valued more highly than other effects, which may be difficult to activate and take advantage of in PvP modes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of Gambler’s Dodge or Acrobat's Dodge is recommended, as the reload effect granted by Spirit of the Dragon makes the use of Marksman’s Dodge redundant.</p>
