            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of Synthoceps. Spirit of Hoarfrost creates a wall of Stasis Crystals upon casting a Barricade, which 
                requires very specific situations to be powerful and provides no effect with the Thruster Class Ability. However, the Melee damage boost provided by Spirit of 
                Synthoceps is extremely valuable to Prismatic Titan, as it is a very Melee-focused class in general. If the player can find use for Spirit of the Hoarfrost, then 
                this combination can provide much more benefits than similar combinations which lack utility. This combination is placed in the C tier solely for the Melee boost 
                provided by Spirit of Synthoceps, but it may rank higher for players that can take full advantage of Spirit of Hoarfrost.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Consecration Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Synthoceps significantly. There is also a present bug in which the Consecration attacks are not correctly shattering Stasis Crystals, which will provide a direct synergy upon being fixed.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of the Star-Eater. However, Spirit of the Star-Eater provides a very potent Super Ability damage boost that 
                Titans do not traditionally have access to, which makes any combination with this perk present potent on its own. Spirit of Hoarfrost requires specific situations 
                to be powerful, and provides no benefit with the Thruster Class Ability. However, Spirit of Hoarfrost, if used correctly, can both provide defensive utility in the 
                form of cover to hide behind as well as offensive utility from shattering the Stasis Crystals created. This combination is placed in the C tier solely for the Super 
                damage boost provided by Spirit of the Star-Eater, but it may rank higher for players that can take full advantage of Spirit of Hoarfrost.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Star-Eater is most effective when used with the Twilight Arsenal Super Ability, as it is the highest burst damage Super Ability accessible to Prismatic Titan. It sees similar effectiveness across all other Super Abilities.</p>

            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of Verity. However, by incorporating the use of the Glacier Grenade, high uptime on potent Shatter 
                damage can be achieved through both Spirit of Hoarfrost’s Crystals and the Glacier Grenade Crystals, which are boosted by Spirit of Verity. Outside of this 
                interaction, however, the utility of this combination is weaker since no direct synergy exists between the two effects. Due to the lack of synergy, this combination 
                is placed in the D tier, but may rank slightly higher in situations that favor the use of Spirit of Hoarfrost.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Unbreakable Aspect is boosted by Spirit of Verity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Maintaining Spirit of Verity stacks will always depend on your original Grenade’s element. For example, if you have an Arc-element Grenade equipped, Spirit of Verity will always require Arc-elemental Weapon kills, even if Transcendence is active with its unique Grenade element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>

            <h5>"Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby targets to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of Contact. However, Spirit of Contact provides very potent offensive utility with its Jolting lightning 
                strikes. Spirit of Hoarfrost can provide both offensive and defensive utility in the form of its Stasis Crystals, Shattering them for damage or using them as 
                on-demand cover. In situations that favor the use of Spirit of Hoarfrost, this combination may provide notable utility, only falling behind other options due 
                to the lack of direct offensive power provided by Spirit of Hoarfrost. This combination is placed in the C tier due to Spirit of Contact’s powerful utility, 
                however it may rank higher for players that can utilize Spirit of Hoarfrost effectively.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Jolt effect provided by Spirit of Contact stuns Overload Champions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Contact can be used to summon lightning strikes at range by using the Shield Throw Melee Ability. Additionally, the first wave from the Consecration Aspect’s unique Melee attack will trigger the lightning strikes, allowing the player to activate Spirit of Contact by using only half of a Melee charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There is a present bug in which the Consecration attacks are not correctly shattering Stasis Crystals, which may provide a direct synergy upon being fixed.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/scars.png"></img>Spirit of Scars</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of Scars, both aim to provide defensive utility through the Stasis Crystal Barricade from 
                Spirit of Hoarfrost and the potent Restoration effect from Spirit of Scars. However, Spirit of Scars is frequently sufficient as a source of defensive utility, 
                and Spirit of Hoarfrost’s offensive utility can be inconsistent if the Barricade is misplaced or enemies leave its effective range. Spirit of Scars is more effective 
                if paired with a powerful offensive perk. Due to the lack of synergy and offensive power provided, this combination is placed in the C tier. However, it may rank 
                slightly higher if Spirit of Hoarfrost can be utilized offensively.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Scars may provide a much-needed survivability boost to Prismatic Titan, which notoriously lacks sustain options outside of the Knockout Aspect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to match either a Special Weapon or Heavy Weapon element to your equipped Super for Spirit of Scars, since the damage output provided will allow for much easier access to the Restoration effect if needed urgently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There is a present bug in which the Consecration attacks are not correctly shattering Stasis Crystals, which may provide a direct synergy upon being fixed.</p>

            <h5>"Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A synergy seems to exist between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of Horn, as both provide an effect upon casting a Barricade. However, as standalone perks, the effects 
                lack overall power and utility, with Spirit of Hoarfrost being slightly versatile in its ability to provide both offensive and defensive utility through its Stasis 
                Crystals. Spirit of the Horn requires enemy targets to be relatively stationary, otherwise the majority of its power is lost. Most importantly, the Solar wave from 
                Spirit of the Horn does not interact with the Stasis Crystals created by Spirit of Hoarfrost, meaning there is no direct synergy in that regard. This combination 
                will also provide zero benefit if used with the Thruster Class Ability. Due to the lack of offensive utility and direct synergy between the two perks, this 
                combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of the Horn can immediately trigger an Ignition if the Solar wave hits an enemy both upon being released and upon returning to the Barricade. It possesses no tracking abilities, however, so this requires the enemy to be relatively stationary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There is a present bug in which the Consecration attacks are not correctly shattering Stasis Crystals, which may provide a direct synergy upon being fixed.</p>

            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: D</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A direct synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of Alpha Lupi, providing a minor heal effect upon casting the unique Stasis Crystal Barricade. However, 
                the heal effect provided by Spirit of Alpha Lupi is frequently unreliable as a form of defensive utility, and Spirit of Hoarfrost’s effectiveness can fluctuate 
                depending on the situation. It also provides zero benefits if used with the Thruster Class Ability. The result is a combination that provides inconsistent and 
                unreliable offensive and defensive utility, which can be better supplemented by many other combinations. Due to the lack of synergy and consistency, this combination 
                is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Spirit of Alpha Lupi and Spirit of Hoarfrost both require either Towering or Rally Barricade. They provide no effect with Thruster.</p>

                    <p>The chosen Barricade Ability is irrelevant, as Spirit of Hoarfrost has a static base cooldown and Crystal formation.</p>

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>No synergy exists between Spirit of Hoarfrost and Spirit of the Armamentarium. However, Spirit of the Armamentarium provides a universally useful bonus Grenade 
                charge, and Spirit of Hoarfrost can situationally provide both offensive and defensive utility. However, this combination lacks consistent, potent utility from 
                both of its options, since they both serve to supplement a more powerful effect but do not properly utilize each other. Spirit of Hoarfrost will additionally 
                provide no benefit if used with the Thruster Class Ability, and its overall effectiveness heavily depends on the inconsistent behavior of enemy targets. Due to 
                the lack of synergy and consistent utility, this combination is placed in the D tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
