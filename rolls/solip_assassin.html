            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/synthoceps.png"></img>Spirit of Synthoceps</h4>
            <h5>"Improves melee damage when you're surrounded."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: A</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of Synthoceps grants a strong boost to Melee damage while surrounded, while Spirit of the Assassin allows you to become Invisible upon obtaining powered Melee 
                final blows. There is strong synergy within this combination, especially in difficult content where being within close range of an enemy is incredibly dangerous – 
                this combination allows you to perform powerful Melee attacks while also escaping danger via Invisibility.The Melee abilities accessible by Warlock, however, commonly 
                do not inflict strong damage in the first place, instead being utilized to inflict a debuff on an enemy instead. The two most damaging Melee abilities include 
                Incinerator Snap and Arcane Needle, the latter of which is commonly used out of range of Synthoceps. However, when the synergy is applicable, it does boast fairly 
                strong output, and for this reason, this combination is placed in the A tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player manages to create an Ignition using the Incinerator Snap Melee Ability while Spirit of Synthoceps is active, the Ignition will also receive a major damage boost. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Lightning Surge Aspect is both buffed by Spirit of Synthoceps and activates Spirit of the Assassin. Spirit of Synthoceps allows Lightning Surge to output respectable levels of damage in difficult content, where it would otherwise not perform well.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Star-Eater[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Star-Eater</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/stareater.png"></img>Spirit of the Star-Eater</h4>
            <h5>"While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Star-Eater, both perks are functional on their own. Since Warlocks do not have 
                access to the effects of Star-Eater otherwise, this combination is automatically useful solely due to this one perk existing. However, in difficult content, the 
                Invisibility provided by Spirit of the Assassin can be useful and potentially even life-saving, allowing a moment of reprieve to reposition and regenerate health. 
                For these reasons, this combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Utilizing the Heavy Handed Armor Mod creates a minor direct synergy between the two perks. Upon obtaining a powered Melee final blow, Heavy Handed will create an Orb of Power, which will charge Spirit of the Star-Eater. The Invisibility granted by Spirit of the assassin allows the player to safely retrieve this Orb of Power so that it is not wasted.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Assassin / Verity[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Verity</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/verity.png"></img>Spirit of Verity</h4>
            <h5>"Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Verity actively clash with each other. Spirit of the Assassin requires the player to obtain Melee final blows to trigger the 
                Invisibility effect. However, Spirit of Verity requires elemental Weapon final blows, which will buff the player’s Grenade Ability.While the player is Invisible, 
                they cannot fire their weapons to activate Spirit of Verity. If the player remains Invisible for too long, they risk losing the Grenade damage buff provided by 
                Spirit of Verity. The player is forced to actively sacrifice one aspect of the combination to take advantage of the other, leading to a gameplay experience that 
                feels unintuitive and clunky. Due to these reasons, this combination is in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Since the Grenade damage bonus provided by Spirit of Verity is powerful, doubling Grenade damage at maximum power, it is beneficial to focus on maintaining Spirit of Verity, only taking advantage of Spirit of the Assassin if necessary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is recommended to use both high-damaging Grenade and Melee Abilities. High-damaging Grenade Abilities include Vortex, Storm, and Threadling Grenades, and high-damaging Melee abilities include Incinerator Snap and Arcane Needle.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Assassin / Vesper[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Vesper</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/vesper.png"></img>Spirit of Vesper</h4>
            <h5>"Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Vesper seem to have a bit of synergy on the surface, but they actively clash with each other in practice. Spirit of the Assassin 
                requires powered Melee final blows to become Invisible, while Spirit of Vesper requires the placement of a Rift to create shockwaves that damage enemies. The ideal 
                situation is to create a Rift near enemies so that the shockwaves will deal damage, using Assassin to escape unharmed as necessary. However, the shockwaves created 
                by Vesper are incredibly weak in any moderately difficult content, and the output created by this interaction is not worth the risk required to set it up. The lack 
                of Rift ability regeneration across the entire Prismatic Warlock suite of abilities also dramatically holds this combination back. Because of these reasons, this 
                combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of the Prismatic Fragment “Facet of Hope” is recommended, as it is the only source of Class Ability regeneration boosts in the entire Prismatic Warlock suite of abilities. Using Armor Mods to supplement this is also recommended, such as the Insulation Leg Armor Mod, which grants Class Ability energy upon picking up an Orb of Power.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Harmony[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Harmony</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/harmony.png"></img>Spirit of Harmony</h4>
            <h5>"Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Harmony, the Super Ability regeneration boost provided by Harmony is incredibly potent 
                and often worth using regardless of the perk paired with it. Spirit of the Assassin is a supplementary effect to this combination, allowing the user to obtain a 
                powered Melee final blow to escape from a potentially dangerous situation utilizing the Invisibility effect. There is no explicit synergy, but the perks are useful 
                separately. Due to the high uptime that Spirit of Harmony allows for Super Abilities in combination with the supplementary effects of Spirit of the Assassin, this 
                combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of a high-damaging Melee Ability is recommended to easily activate Spirit of the Assassin on-demand. These Melee Abilities include Incinerator Snap and Arcane Needle. The Lightning Surge Aspect can be utilized in less difficult content, but falls behind other options with regards to damage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Since Spirit of Harmony requires the player to match their Weapon element with their Super element, it is easy to incorporate the “Harmonic” Armor Mods into their armor, which reward element-matching in this way through a reduced energy cost.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Starfire[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Starfire</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin."</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/starfire.png"></img>Spirit of Starfire</h4>
            <h5>"Grenades recharge from empowered weapon damage, with empowered weapon final blows granting more energy."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: F</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>An explicit anti-synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of Starfire. Spirit of the Assassin requires powered Melee final blows to become invisible. 
                While Invisible, the player cannot take advantage of Spirit of Starfire’s Grenade Ability regeneration while inside of an Empowering Rift. Spirit of Starfire also 
                does not grant any Melee-related benefits at all, while also forcing the use of the Empowering Rift, which provides no defensive utility and has an overall weak 
                effect compared to the two other Class Ability options. The restrictions placed on the Grenade Ability regeneration by Starfire makes the perk incredibly weak 
                overall, and with the two perks actively working against each other in gameplay, this combination is placed in the F tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Due to the lack of Class Ability regeneration effects for Spirit of Starfire, the Prismatic Fragment Facet of Hope is recommended to supplement this, as well as Class Ability-related Armor Mods.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The use of a high-damaging Melee Ability is recommended to easily activate Spirit of the Assassin on-demand. These Melee Abilities include Incinerator Snap and Arcane Needle. The Lightning Surge Aspect can be utilized in less difficult content, but falls behind other options with regards to damage.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!--Assassin / Swarm[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/swarm.png"></img>Swarm</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/swarm.png"></img>Spirit of the Swarm</h4>
            <h5>"Destroying a Tangle spawns Threadlings."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: C</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>While no explicit synergy exists between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Swarm, the two perks are beneficial on their own. Spirit of the Assassin can be used 
                as a safety net, obtaining a powered Melee kill to utilize the Invisibility. Spirit of the Swarm adds an additional supplementary damage source in the form of Strand 
                Threadlings created from Tangles, which will both attack enemies for the player and provide a bonus source of Darkness Transcendence energy. The combination is not 
                incredibly powerful on its own, but neither of the perks are inherently bad. Both have use cases that commonly appear in gameplay. For these reasons, this 
                combination is placed in the C tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability is strongly recommended, as not only is it a strong Melee for activating Spirit of the Assassin, but it also will allow for easy creation of Strand Tangles. If using a different Melee Ability, use of the Prismatic Fragment “Facet of Awakening” is recommended alongside a Strand-elemental Weapon for producing Tangles.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player has acquired the Linear Fusion Rifle Euphony, Spirit of the Swarm is a very popular choice to help maintain uptime on the Spindle damage boost.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--Assassin / Claw[1]-->
        <button class="collapsible"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Assassin + <img class="icon" src="../icons/claw.png"></img>Claw</button>
        <div class="collcontent">
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/assassin.png"></img>Spirit of the Assassin</h4>
            <h5>"Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4"><img class="icon" src="../icons/claw.png"></img>Spirit of the Claw</h4>
            <h5>"Gain an additional melee charge."</h5>
            <h4 class="d2header4">Tier List Ranking: B</h4>
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>There is explicit synergy between Spirit of the Assassin and Spirit of the Claw. Having an additional Melee Ability charge from Spirit of the Claw directly allows for 
                more opportunities to utilize the Invisibility from obtaining powered Melee final blows through Spirit of the Assassin. This is a very powerful tool for pure defense, 
                as the player can maintain a stash of Melee Abilities to use for Invisibility to escape from potentially dangerous situations. However, this combination is strictly 
                focused on defense, meaning that offense will need to be supplemented in some other way through the other Abilities selected. For this reason, this 
                combination is in the B tier.</p>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Arcane Needle Melee Ability is strongly recommended, as it will have a total of four charges accessible because of Spirit of the Claw. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Most of a Prismatic Warlock’s offensive power is sourced from their Abilities, so utilizing the Feed the Void Aspect to supplement offensive power through the Grenade Ability is recommended. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In less difficult content, the Lightning Surge Aspect can be used, allowing the player to use the unique Melee attack on a group of enemies and escaping safely through Spirit of the Assassin.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
